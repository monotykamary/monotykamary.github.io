<a class=anchor href=#magic-items-m>#</a></h1><h3 id=mace-of-disruption>Mace of Disruption
<a class=anchor href=#mace-of-disruption>#</a></h3><p><em>Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p><p>While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p><h3 id=mace-of-smiting>Mace of Smiting
<a class=anchor href=#mace-of-smiting>#</a></h3><p><em>Weapon (mace), rare</em></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.</p><p>When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it&rsquo;s a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.</p><h3 id=mace-of-terror>Mace of Terror
<a class=anchor href=#mace-of-terror>#</a></h3><p><em>Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><h3 id=mantle-of-spell-resistance>Mantle of Spell Resistance
<a class=anchor href=#mantle-of-spell-resistance>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.</p><h3 id=manual-of-bodily-health>Manual of Bodily Health
<a class=anchor href=#manual-of-bodily-health>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>This book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book&rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.</p><h3 id=manual-of-gainful-exercise>Manual of Gainful Exercise
<a class=anchor href=#manual-of-gainful-exercise>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book&rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.</p><h3 id=manual-of-golems>Manual of Golems
<a class=anchor href=#manual-of-golems>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can&rsquo;t use a <em>manual of golems</em> and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.</p><p><strong>Table- Manual of Golems</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Golem</th><th>Time</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-5</td><td>Clay</td><td>30 days</td><td>65,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>6-17</td><td>Flesh</td><td>60 days</td><td>50,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Iron</td><td>120 days</td><td>100,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>19-20</td><td>Stone</td><td>90 days</td><td>80,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.</p><p>Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.</p><h3 id=manual-of-quickness-of-action>Manual of Quickness of Action
<a class=anchor href=#manual-of-quickness-of-action>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book&rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.</p><h3 id=marvelous-pigments>Marvelous Pigments
<a class=anchor href=#marvelous-pigments>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.</p><p>Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons - that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p><p>When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.</p><p>Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p><p>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.</p><h3 id=medallion-of-thoughts>Medallion of Thoughts
<a class=anchor href=#medallion-of-thoughts>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the <em>detect thoughts</em> spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><h3 id=mirror-of-life-trapping>Mirror of Life Trapping
<a class=anchor href=#mirror-of-life-trapping>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>When this 4-foot tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.</p><p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror&rsquo;s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror&rsquo;s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p><p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror&rsquo;s cells don&rsquo;t age, and they don&rsquo;t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p><p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p><p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror&rsquo;s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.</p><p>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p><h3 id=mithral-armor>Mithral Armor
<a class=anchor href=#mithral-armor>#</a></h3><p><em>Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon</em></p><p>Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn&rsquo;t.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ol><li><ol><li><a href=#mace-of-disruption>Mace of Disruption</a></li><li><a href=#mace-of-smiting>Mace of Smiting</a></li><li><a href=#mace-of-terror>Mace of Terror</a></li><li><a href=#mantle-of-spell-resistance>Mantle of Spell Resistance</a></li><li><a href=#manual-of-bodily-health>Manual of Bodily Health</a></li><li><a href=#manual-of-gainful-exercise>Manual of Gainful Exercise</a></li><li><a href=#manual-of-golems>Manual of Golems</a></li><li><a href=#manual-of-quickness-of-action>Manual of Quickness of Action</a></li><li><a href=#marvelous-pigments>Marvelous Pigments</a></li><li><a href=#medallion-of-thoughts>Medallion of Thoughts</a></li><li><a href=#mirror-of-life-trapping>Mirror of Life Trapping</a></li><li><a href=#mithral-armor>Mithral Armor</a></li></ol></li></ol></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
