For data intensive SPAs with CPU-intensive tasks, the single-threaded nature of Javascript starts to hinder the application's perceived performance when you cannot fit those CPU-intensive tasks into a 16.67 ms/frame window (translates to 60fps). That doesn't even account for code execution time of frameworks (React, Vue...etc), which then leaves you with approximately only a 10 ms/frame window or less to complete all your tasks on the main thread to make user interaction feel smooth and snappy.","tags":["javascript","frontend/performance"],"authors":["phatgha"],"date":"Wed Aug 31 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","category":"playground > Frontend"},{"id":"149","file_path":"playground/Frontend/Retain scroll position in infinite scroll.md","title":"Retain scroll position in infinite scroll","description":"Infinite scroll has become a popular web design technique in recent years, as it offers several benefits over traditional pagination models.
