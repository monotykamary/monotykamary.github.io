Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.
These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/backgrounds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/backgrounds/</guid><description>Backgrounds Every story has a beginning. Your character&amp;rsquo;s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.
Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character&amp;rsquo;s identity.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/beyond-1st-level/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/beyond-1st-level/</guid><description>Beyond 1st Level As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.
When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/feats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/feats/</guid><description>Feats A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.
At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat&amp;rsquo;s description says otherwise.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/inspiration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/inspiration/</guid><description>Inspiration Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/languages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/languages/</guid><description>Languages Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.
Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM&amp;rsquo;s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves&amp;rsquo; cant or the tongue of druids.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/multiclassing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/characterizations/multiclassing/</guid><description>MULTICLASSING Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.
With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/classes/barbarian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/classes/barbarian/</guid><description>Barbarian Class Features As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.

For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/coinage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/coinage/</guid><description>Coinage Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/expenses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/expenses/</guid><description>Expenses When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/selling-treasure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/selling-treasure/</guid><description>Selling Treasure Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.
Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market.

Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool.

It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).
Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/transportation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/equipment/transportation/</guid><description>Mounts and Vehicles A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down.

Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/diseases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/diseases/</guid><description>Diseases A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.
A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/madness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/madness/</guid><description>Madness In a typical campaign, characters aren&amp;rsquo;t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.
Going Mad Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/objects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/objects/</guid><description>Objects When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire&amp;rsquo;s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character&amp;rsquo;s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/pantheons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/pantheons/</guid><description>Pantheons The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world&amp;rsquo;s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.
The Celtic Pantheon It&amp;rsquo;s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/planes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/planes/</guid><description>Planes The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the planes of existence. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/poisons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/poisons/</guid><description>Poisons Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.
Poisons come in the following four types.
Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/traps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gamemastering/traps/</guid><description>Traps Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gameplay/abilities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gameplay/abilities/</guid><description>ABILITIES Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature&amp;rsquo;s physical and mental characteristics:
Strength, measuring physical power Dexterity, measuring agility Constitution, measuring endurance Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory Wisdom, measuring perception and insight Charisma, measuring force of personality Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature&amp;rsquo;s assets as well as weaknesses.

The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers&amp;rsquo; movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gameplay/combat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/gameplay/combat/</guid><description>COMBAT A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/monsters-alt/creatures-a-c/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/monsters-alt/creatures-a-c/</guid><description>Creatures (A-C) Ape Medium beast, unaligned

Racial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn&amp;rsquo;t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook.
Spell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/monsters/darkmantle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/monsters/darkmantle/</guid><description>Darkmantle Small monstrosity, unaligned

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the gust of wind spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/treasure/winged-boots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/treasure/winged-boots/</guid><description>Winged Boots Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/treasure/wings-of-flying/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monotykamary.github.io/posts/references/treasure/wings-of-flying/</guid><description>Wings of Flying Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can&amp;rsquo;t use them again for 1d12 hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
