The following entries appear among the traits of most races.\nAbility Score Increase # Every race increases one or more of a character\u0026rsquo;s ability scores.\nAge # The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race\u0026rsquo;s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.\nAlignment # Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.\nSize # Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in \u0026ldquo;Equipment.\u0026rdquo;\nSpeed # Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (\u0026ldquo;Adventuring\u0026rdquo;) and fighting (\u0026ldquo;Combat\u0026rdquo;).\nLanguages # By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.\nSubraces # Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.\nDwarf # Dwarf Traits # Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2.\nAge. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they\u0026rsquo;re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.\nAlignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.\nSize. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\nDarkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nDwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\nDwarven Combat Training. You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.\nTool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with the artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools of your choice: smith\u0026rsquo;s tools, brewer\u0026rsquo;s supplies, or mason\u0026rsquo;s tools.\nStonecunning. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.\nHill Dwarf # As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.\nDwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\nElf # Elf Traits # Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.\nAge. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.\nAlignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others\u0026rsquo; freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.\nSize. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\nDarkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nKeen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\nFey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can\u0026rsquo;t put you to sleep.\nTrance. Elves don\u0026rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is \u0026ldquo;trance.\u0026rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.\nAfter resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.\nHigh Elf # As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.\nElf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\nCantrip. You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.\nExtra Language. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.\nHalfling # Halfling Traits # Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.\nAge. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.\nAlignment. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.\nSize. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\nLucky. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\nBrave. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\nHalfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn\u0026rsquo;t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don\u0026rsquo;t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.\nLightfoot # As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You\u0026rsquo;re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.\nLightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.\nNaturally Stealthy. You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.\nHuman # Human Traits # It\u0026rsquo;s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.\nAbility Score Increase. Your ability scores each increase by 1.\nAge. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\nAlignment. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.\nSize. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.\nDragonborn # Dragonborn Traits # Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\nAge. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.\nAlignment. Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible villains.\nSize. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\nTable- Draconic Ancestry\nDragon Damage Type Breath Weapon Black Acid 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Blue Lightning 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Brass Fire 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Bronze Lightning 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Copper Acid 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Gold Fire 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) Green Poison 15 ft. cone (Con. save) Red Fire 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) Silver Cold 15 ft. cone (Con. save) White Cold 15 ft. cone (Con. save) Draconic Ancestry. You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.\nBreath Weapon. You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.\nWhen you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.\nAfter you use your breath weapon, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.\nDamage Resistance. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.\nGnome # Gnome Traits # Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all other gnomes.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2.\nAge. Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.\nAlignment. Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.\nSize. Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\nDarkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nGnome Cunning. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.\nRock Gnome # As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1.\nArtificer\u0026rsquo;s Lore. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.\nTinker. You have proficiency with artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools (tinker\u0026rsquo;s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.\nWhen you create a device, choose one of the following options:\nClockwork Toy. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.\nFire Starter. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.\nMusic Box. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song\u0026rsquo;s end or when it is closed.\nHalf-Elf # Half-Elf Traits # Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\nAge. Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.\nAlignment. Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others\u0026rsquo; demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.\nSize. Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\nDarkvision. Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nFey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can\u0026rsquo;t put you to sleep.\nSkill Versatility. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.\nLanguages.

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\nAge. Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.\nAlignment. Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.\nSize. Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\nDarkvision. Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nMenacing. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\nRelentless Endurance. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nSavage Attacks. When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon\u0026rsquo;s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.\nTiefling # Tiefling Traits # Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal descent.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.\nAge. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.\nAlignment.

Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\nDarkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nHellish Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage.\nInfernal Legacy. You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.\nClasses # Barbarian # Class Features # As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d12 per barbarian level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Strength, Constitution\nSkills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon An explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack and four javelins Table- The Barbarian\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Rages Rage Damage 1st +2 Rage, Unarmored Defense 2 +2 2nd +2 Reckless Attack, Danger Sense 2 +2 3rd +2 Primal Path 3 +2 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 +2 5th +3 Extra Attack, Fast Movement 3 +2 6th +3 Path feature 4 +2 7th +3 Feral Instinct 4 +2 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 +2 9th +4 Brutal Critical (1 die) 4 +3 10th +4 Path feature 4 +3 11th +4 Relentless 4 +3 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 +3 13th +5 Brutal Critical (2 dice) 5 +3 14th +5 Path feature 5 +3 15th +5 Persistent Rage 5 +3 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 5 +4 17th +6 Brutal Critical (3 dice) 6 +4 18th +6 Indomitable Might 6 +4 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 6 +4 20th +6 Primal Champion Unlimited +4 Rage # In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing heavy armor:\nYou have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you are able to cast spells, you can\u0026rsquo;t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven\u0026rsquo;t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.\nUnarmored Defense # While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.\nReckless Attack # Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.\nDanger Sense # At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren\u0026rsquo;t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can\u0026rsquo;t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.\nPrimal Path # At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nFast Movement # Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing heavy armor.\nFeral Instinct # By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.\nBrutal Critical # Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\nRelentless Rage # Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you\u0026rsquo;re raging and don\u0026rsquo;t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.\nPersistent Rage # Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\nIndomitable Might # Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\nPrimal Champion # At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\nBarbarian Paths # Path of the Berserker # For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker\u0026rsquo;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\nFrenzy # Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).\nMindless Rage # Beginning at 6th level, you can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.\nIntimidating Presence # Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.\nRetaliation # Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.\nBard # Class Features # As a bard, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per bard level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor\nWeapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords\nTools: Three musical instruments of your choice\nSaving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma\nSkills: Choose any three\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon (a) a diplomat\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an entertainer\u0026rsquo;s pack (a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument Leather armor and a dagger Table- The Bard\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Spells Known Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Spellcasting, Bardic Inspiration (d6) 2 4 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Jack of All Trades, Song of Rest (d6) 2 5 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 Bard College, Expertise 2 6 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 7 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 Bardic Inspiration (d8), Font of Inspiration 3 8 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Countercharm, Bard College Feature 3 9 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 3 10 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 3 11 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 Song of Rest (d8) 3 12 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Bardic Inspiration (d10), Expertise, Magical Secrets 4 14 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 - 4 15 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 15 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 Song of Rest (d10) 4 16 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Magical Secrets, Bard College Feature 4 18 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 Bardic Inspiration (d12) 4 19 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 19 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 Song of Rest (d12) 4 20 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Magical Secrets 4 22 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 22 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Superior Inspiration 4 22 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Spellcasting # You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.\nYour spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.\nCantrips # You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.\nSpell Slots # The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher # You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability # Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a musical instrument (see chapter ##, \u0026ldquo;Equipment\u0026rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nBardic Inspiration # You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nJack of All Trades # Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn\u0026rsquo;t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest # Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nBard College # At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.\nExpertise # At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nFont of Inspiration # Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.\nCountercharm # At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).\nMagical Secrets # By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.\nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.\nYou learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.\nSuperior Inspiration # At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.\nBard Colleges # College of Lore # Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\nThe college\u0026rsquo;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.\nBonus Proficiencies # When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\nCutting Words # Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature\u0026rsquo;s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can\u0026rsquo;t hear you or if it\u0026rsquo;s immune to being charmed.\nAdditional Magical Secrets # At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of bard spells you know.\nPeerless Skill # Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.\nCleric # Class Features # As a cleric, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per cleric level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma\nSkills: Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient) (a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient) (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon (a) a priest\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack A shield and a holy symbol Table- The Cleric\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Spellcasting, Divine Domain 3 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Channel Divinity (1/rest), Divine Domain Feature 3 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 - 3 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 Destroy Undead (CR 1/2) 4 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Channel Divinity (2/rest), Divine Domain Feature 4 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 4 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement, Destroy Undead (CR 1), Divine Domain Feature 4 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 - 4 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Divine Intervention 5 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 Destroy Undead (CR 2) 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Destroy Undead (CR 3) 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 Destroy Undead (CR 4), Divine Domain Feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Channel Divinity (3/rest) 5 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Divine Intervention improvement 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Spellcasting # As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.\nCantrips # At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells # The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a holy symbol (see chapter ##, \u0026ldquo;Equipment\u0026rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.\nDivine Domain # Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.\nDomain Spells # Each domain has a list of spells - its domain spells - that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.\nChannel Divinity # At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead # As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u0026rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nDestroy Undead # Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.\nTable- Destroy Undead\nCleric Level Destroys Undead of CR \u0026hellip; 5th 1/2 or lower 8th 1 or lower 11th 2 or lower 14th 3 or lower 17th 4 or lower Divine Intervention # Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.\nImploring your deity\u0026rsquo;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.\nIf your deity intervenes, you can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.\nCleric Domains # Life Domain # The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy-one of the fundamental forces of the universe-that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).\nTable- Life Domain Spells\nCleric Level Spells 1st bless, cure wounds 3rd lesser restoration, spiritual weapon 5th beacon of hope, revivify 7th death ward, guardian of faith 9th mass cure wounds, raise dead Bonus Proficiency # When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.\nDisciple of Life # Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level.\nChannel Divinity: Preserve Life # Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature on an undead or a construct.\nBlessed Healer # Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level.\nDivine Strike # At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\nSupreme Healing # Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.\nDruid # Class Features # As a druid, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per druid level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)\nWeapons: Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears\nTools: Herbalism kit\nSaving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom\nSkills: Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon Leather armor, an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack, and a druidic focus Table- The Druid\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Druidic, Spellcasting 2 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Wild Shape, Druid Circle 2 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 - 2 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Wild Shape Improvement, Ability Score Improvement 3 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 - 3 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Druid Circle feature 3 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 3 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Wild Shape Improvement, Ability Score Improvement 3 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 - 3 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Druid Circle feature 4 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Druid Circle feature 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Timeless Body, Beast Spells 4 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Archdruid 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Druidic # You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells # The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a druidic focus (see chapter ##, \u0026ldquo;Equipment\u0026rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.\nWild Shape # Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a flying or swimming speed.\nTable- Beast Shapes\nLevel Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature\u0026rsquo;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can\u0026rsquo;t use them. When you transform, you assume the beast\u0026rsquo;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious. You can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn\u0026rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you\u0026rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you\u0026rsquo;ve already cast. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can\u0026rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u0026rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn\u0026rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\u0026rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle # At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nTimeless Body # Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.\nBeast Spells # Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren\u0026rsquo;t able to provide material components.\nArchdruid # At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren\u0026rsquo;t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\nDruid Circles # Circle of the Land # The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle\u0026rsquo;s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle\u0026rsquo;s mysterious rites.\nBonus Cantrip # When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.\nNatural Recovery # Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.\nCircle Spells # Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells.\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\nTable- Arctic Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd hold person, spike growth 5th sleet storm, slow 7th freedom of movement, ice storm 9th commune with nature, cone of cold Table- Coast Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd mirror image, misty step 5th water breathing, water walk 7th control water, freedom of movement 9th conjure elemental, scrying Table- Desert Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd blur, silence 5th create food and water, protection from energy 7th blight, hallucinatory terrain 9th insect plague, wall of stone Table- Forest Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd barkskin, spider climb 5th call lightning, plant growth 7th divination, freedom of movement 9th commune with nature, tree stride Table- Grassland Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd invisibility, pass without trace 5th daylight, haste 7th divination, freedom of movement 9th dream, insect plague Table- Mountain Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd spider climb, spike growth 5th lightning bolt, meld into stone 7th stone shape, stoneskin 9th passwall, wall of stone Table- Swamp Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd acid arrow, darkness 5th water walk, stinking cloud 7th freedom of movement, locate creature 9th insect plague, scrying Land\u0026rsquo;s Stride # Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.\nNature\u0026rsquo;s Ward # When you reach 10th level, you can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.\nNature\u0026rsquo;s Sanctuary # When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.\nSacred Plants and Wood\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\nDruids and the Gods\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.\nFighter # Class Features # As a fighter, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: All armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Strength, Constitution\nSkills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal, Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) chain mail or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes (a) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack Table- The Fighter\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features 1st +2 Fighting Style, Second Wind 2nd +2 Action Surge (one use) 3rd +2 Martial Archetype 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3 Extra Attack 6th +3 Ability Score Improvement 7th +3 Martial Archetype Feature 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 9th +4 Indomitable (one use) 10th +4 Martial Archetype Feature 11th +4 Extra Attack (2) 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 13th +5 Indomitable (two uses) 14th +5 Ability Score Improvement 15th +5 Martial Archetype Feature 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 17th +6 Action Surge (two uses), Indomitable (three uses) 18th +6 Martial Archetype Feature 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 20th +6 Extra Attack (3) Fighting Style # You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.\nAction Surge # Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.\nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.\nMartial Archetype # At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nYou can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.\nMartial Archetypes # Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.\nChampion # The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.\nImproved Critical # Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.\nRemarkable Athlete # Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn\u0026rsquo;t already use your proficiency bonus.\nIn addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.\nAdditional Fighting Style # At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.\nSuperior Critical # Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.\nSurvivor # At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don\u0026rsquo;t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.\nMonk # Class Features # As a monk, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per monk level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: None\nWeapons: Simple weapons, shortswords\nTools: Choose one type of artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools or one musical instrument\nSaving Throws: Strength, Dexterity\nSkills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon (a) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack 10 darts Table- The Monk\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Martial Arts Ki Points Unarmored Movement Features 1st +2 1d4 - - Unarmored Defense, Martial Arts 2nd +2 1d4 2 +10 ft.

Perfect Self Unarmored Defense # Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.\nMartial Arts # At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don\u0026rsquo;t have the two- handed or heavy property.\nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing armor or wielding a shield:\nYou can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven\u0026rsquo;t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.\nKi # Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature\u0026rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nFlurry of Blows # Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\nPatient Defense # You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\nStep of the Wind # You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\nUnarmored Movement # Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\nMonastic Tradition # When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\nDeflect Missiles # Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSlow Fall # Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nStunning Strike # Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent\u0026rsquo;s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.\nKi-Empowered Strikes # Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nEvasion # At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon\u0026rsquo;s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nStillness of Mind # Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.\nPurity of Body # At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.\nTongue of the Sun and Moon # Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.\nDiamond Soul # Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.\nTimeless Body # At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can\u0026rsquo;t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.\nEmpty Body # Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can\u0026rsquo;t take any other creatures with you.\nPerfect Self # At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.\nMonastic Traditions # Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.\nWay of the Open Hand # Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.\nOpen Hand Technique # Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy\u0026rsquo;s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\nIt must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. It can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions until the end of your next turn. Wholeness of Body # At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\nTranquility # Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.\nQuivering Palm # At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone\u0026rsquo;s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.\nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.\nPaladin # Class Features # As a paladin, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d10 per paladin level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: All armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma\nSkills: Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon (a) a priest\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack Chain mail and a holy symbol Table- The Paladin\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 1st +2 Divine Sense, Lay on Hands - - - - - 2nd +2 Fighting Style, Spellcasting, Divine Smite 2 - - - - 3rd +2 Divine Health, Sacred Oath 3 - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 - - - - 5th +3 Extra Attack 4 2 - - - 6th +3 Aura of Protection 4 2 - - - 7th +3 Sacred Oath feature 4 3 - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 - - - 9th +4 - 4 3 2 - - 10th +4 Aura of Courage 4 3 2 - - 11th +4 Improved Divine Smite 4 3 3 - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 3 - - 13th +5 - 4 3 3 1 - 14th +5 Cleansing Touch 4 3 3 1 - 15th +5 Sacred Oath feature 4 3 3 2 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 3 2 - 17th +6 - 4 3 3 3 1 18th +6 Aura improvements 4 3 3 3 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 3 3 2 20th +6 Sacred Oath feature 4 3 3 3 2 Divine Sense # The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.\nLay on Hands # Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\nFighting Style # At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can\u0026rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nDefense # While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nDueling # When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nGreat Weapon Fighting # When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\nProtection # When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.\nSpellcasting # By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.\nPreparing and Casting Spells # The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\nDivine Smite # Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon\u0026rsquo;s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.\nDivine Health # By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\nSacred Oath # When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\nOath Spells # Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\nChannel Divinity # Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nAura of Protection # Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nAura of Courage # Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can\u0026rsquo;t be frightened while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nImproved Divine Smite # By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.\nCleansing Touch # Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nSacred Oaths # Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin\u0026rsquo;s training. Some characters with this class don\u0026rsquo;t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin\u0026rsquo;s heart.\nOath of Devotion # The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods\u0026rsquo; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion # Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\nHonesty. Don\u0026rsquo;t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\nCourage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.\nCompassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.\nHonor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.\nDuty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\nOath Spells # You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\nTable- Oath of Devotion Spells\nLevel Paladin Spells 3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary 5th lesser restoration, zone of truth 9th beacon of hope, dispel magic 13th freedom of movement, guardian of faith 17th commune, flame strike Channel Divinity # When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\nSacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\nTurn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u0026rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAura of Devotion # Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nPurity of Spirit # Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\nHoly Nimbus # At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.\nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.\nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.\nBreaking Your Oath\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.\nRanger # Class Features # As a ranger, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d10 per ranger level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Strength, Dexterity\nSkills: Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons (a) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows Table- The Ranger\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Spells Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 1st +2 Favored Enemy, Natural Explorer - - - - - - 2nd +2 Fighting Style, Spellcasting 2 2 - - - - 3rd +2 Ranger Archetype, Primeval Awareness 3 3 - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 3 - - - - 5th +3 Extra Attack 4 4 2 - - - 6th +3 Favored Enemy and Natural Explorer improvements 4 4 2 - - - 7th +3 Ranger Archetype feature 5 4 3 - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement, Land\u0026rsquo;s Stride 5 4 3 - - - 9th +4 - 6 4 3 2 - - 10th +4 Natural Explorer improvement, Hide in Plain Sight 6 4 3 2 - - 11th +4 Ranger Archetype feature 7 4 3 3 - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 7 4 3 3 - - 13th +5 - 8 4 3 3 1 - 14th +5 Favored Enemy improvement, Vanish 8 4 3 3 1 - 15th +5 Ranger Archetype feature 9 4 3 3 2 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 9 4 3 3 2 - 17th +6 - 10 4 3 3 3 1 18th +6 Feral Senses 10 4 3 3 3 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 11 4 3 3 3 2 20th +6 Foe Slayer 11 4 3 3 3 2 Favored Enemy # Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.\nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.\nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.\nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.\nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.\nNatural Explorer # You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in.\nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:\nDifficult terrain doesn\u0026rsquo;t slow your group\u0026rsquo;s travel. Your group can\u0026rsquo;t become lost except by magical means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.\nFighting Style # At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can\u0026rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nArchery # You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.\nDefense # While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nDueling # When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting # When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.\nSpellcasting # By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.\nSpell Slots # The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher # You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability # Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRanger Archetype # At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.\nPrimeval Awareness # Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn\u0026rsquo;t reveal the creatures\u0026rsquo; location or number.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLand\u0026rsquo;s Stride # Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.\nHide in Plain Sight # Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.\nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.\nVanish # Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can\u0026rsquo;t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.\nFeral Senses # At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can\u0026rsquo;t see. When you attack a creature you can\u0026rsquo;t see, your inability to see it doesn\u0026rsquo;t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn\u0026rsquo;t hidden from you and you aren\u0026rsquo;t blinded or deafened.\nFoe Slayer # At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.\nRanger Archetypes # The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.\nHunter # Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter\u0026rsquo;s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.\nHunter\u0026rsquo;s Prey # At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nColossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it\u0026rsquo;s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.\nGiant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.\nHorde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.\nDefensive Tactics # At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEscape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.\nMultiattack Defense. When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.\nSteel Will. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\nMultiattack # At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nVolley. You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon\u0026rsquo;s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.\nWhirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.\nSuperior Hunter\u0026rsquo;s Defense # At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEvasion. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon\u0026rsquo;s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nStand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\nUncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage against you.\nRogue # Class Features # As a rogue, you have the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor\nWeapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords\nTools: Thieves\u0026rsquo; tools\nSaving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence\nSkills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword (a) a burglar\u0026rsquo;s pack, (b) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack, or (c) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves\u0026rsquo; tools Table- The Rogue\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Sneak Attack Features 1st +2 1d6 Expertise, Sneak Attack, Thieves\u0026rsquo; Cant 2nd +2 1d6 Cunning Action 3rd +2 2d6 Roguish Archetype 4th +2 2d6 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3 3d6 Uncanny Dodge 6th +3 3d6 Expertise 7th +3 4d6 Evasion 8th +3 4d6 Ability Score Improvement 9th +4 5d6 Roguish Archetype feature 10th +4 5d6 Ability Score Improvement 11th +4 6d6 Reliable Talent 12th +4 6d6 Ability Score Improvement 13th +5 7d6 Roguish Archetype Feature 14th +5 7d6 Blindsense 15th +5 8d6 Slippery Mind 16th +5 8d6 Ability Score Improvement 17th +6 9d6 Roguish Archetype Feature 18th +6 9d6 Elusive 19th +6 10d6 Ability Score Improvement 20th +6 10d6 Stroke of Luck Expertise # At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools.

Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have disadvantage on the attack roll.\nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.\nThieves\u0026rsquo; Cant # During your rogue training you learned thieves\u0026rsquo; cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves\u0026rsquo; cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves\u0026rsquo; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.\nCunning Action # Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\nRoguish Archetype # At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nUncanny Dodge # Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage against you.\nEvasion # Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon\u0026rsquo;s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nReliable Talent # By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\nBlindsense # Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.\nSlippery Mind # By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength.

No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated.\nStroke of Luck # At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nRoguish Archetypes # Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.\nThief # You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn\u0026rsquo;t employ.\nFast Hands # Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves\u0026rsquo; tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\nSecond-Story Work # When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.\nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.\nSupreme Sneak # Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.\nUse Magic Device # By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.\nThief\u0026rsquo;s Reflexes # When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10.

You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.\nSpell Slots # The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher # You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability # Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\nSorcerous Origin # Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\nFont of Magic # At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.\nSorcery Points # You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.\nFlexible Casting # You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.\nCreating Spell Slots. You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.\nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.\nTable- Creating Spell Slots\nSpell Slot Level Sorcery Point Cost 1st 2 2nd 3 3rd 5 4th 6 5th 7 Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot\u0026rsquo;s level.\nMetamagic # At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.\nCareful Spell # When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell\u0026rsquo;s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.\nDistant Spell # When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.\nEmpowered Spell # When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.\nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.\nExtended Spell # When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.\nHeightened Spell # When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.\nQuickened Spell # When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.\nSubtle Spell # When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.\nTwinned Spell # When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell\u0026rsquo;s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).\nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell\u0026rsquo;s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren\u0026rsquo;t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSorcerous Restoration # At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\nSorcerous Origins # Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.\nDraconic Bloodline # Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\nDragon Ancestor # At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\nTable- Draconic Ancestry\nDragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\nDraconic Resilience # As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\nElemental Affinity # Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\nDragon Wings # At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\nDraconic Presence # Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.\nWarlock # Class Features # As a warlock, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor\nWeapons: Simple weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma\nSkills: Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus (a) a scholar\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers Table- The Warlock\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known Spells Known Spell Slots Slot Level Invocations Known 1st +2 Otherworldly Patron, Pact Magic 2 2 1 1st - 2nd +2 Eldritch Invocations 2 3 2 1st 2 3rd +2 Pact Boon 2 4 2 2nd 2 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 5 2 2nd 2 5th +3 - 3 6 2 3rd 3 6th +3 Otherworldly Patron feature 3 7 2 3rd 3 7th +3 - 3 8 2 4th 4 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 3 9 2 4th 4 9th +4 - 3 10 2 5th 5 10th +4 Otherworldly Patron feature 4 10 2 5th 5 11th +4 Mystic Arcanum (6th level) 4 11 3 5th 5 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 11 3 5th 6 13th +5 Mystic Arcanum (7th level) 4 12 3 5th 6 14th +5 Otherworldly Patron feature 4 12 3 5th 6 15th +5 Mystic Arcanum (8th level) 4 13 3 5th 7 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 13 3 5th 7 17th +6 Mystic Arcanum (9th level) 4 14 4 5th 7 18th +6 - 4 14 4 5th 8 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 15 4 5th 8 20th +6 Eldritch Master 4 15 4 5th 8 Otherworldly Patron # At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nPact Magic # Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.\nCantrips # You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\nSpell Slots # The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher # At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what\u0026rsquo;s shown in the table\u0026rsquo;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability # Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.\nEldritch Invocations # In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.\nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.\nPact Boon # At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.\nPact of the Chain # You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t count against your number of spells known.\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.\nPact of the Blade # You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can\u0026rsquo;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\nPact of the Tome # Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class\u0026rsquo;s spell list (the three needn\u0026rsquo;t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don\u0026rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don\u0026rsquo;t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nMystic Arcanum # At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Master # At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nEldritch Invocations # If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\nAgonizing Blast # Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\nArmor of Shadows # You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nAscendant Step # Prerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nBeast Speech # You can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.\nBeguiling Influence # You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\nBewitching Whispers # Prerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can\u0026rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nBook of Ancient Secrets # Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class\u0026rsquo;s spell list (the two needn\u0026rsquo;t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can\u0026rsquo;t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell\u0026rsquo;s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\nChains of Carceri # Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can cast hold monster at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature\u0026rsquo;s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.\nLifedrinker # Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nMask of Many Faces # You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMaster of Myriad Forms # Prerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMinions of Chaos # Prerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot.

You can\u0026rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThief of Five Fates # You can cast bane once using a warlock spell slot. You can\u0026rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThirsting Blade # Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nVisions of Distant Realms # Prerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot.\nVoice of the Chain Master # Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar\u0026rsquo;s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar\u0026rsquo;s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.\nWhispers of the Grave # Prerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot.\nWitch Sight # Prerequisite: 15th level\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.\nOtherworldly Patrons # The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.\nThe Fiend # You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz\u0026rsquo;Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.\nExpanded Spell List # The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\nTable- Fiend Expanded Spells\nSpell Level Spells 1st burning hands, command 2nd blindness/deafness, scorching ray 3rd fireball, stinking cloud 4th fire shield, wall of fire 5th flame strike, hallow Dark One\u0026rsquo;s Blessing # Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).\nDark One\u0026rsquo;s Own Luck # Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll\u0026rsquo;s effects occur.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nFiendish Resilience # Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.\nHurl Through Hell # Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.\nYour Pact Boon\nEach Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron\u0026rsquo;s nature.\nPact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One\u0026rsquo;s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.\nPact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.\nPact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.\nWizard # Class Features # As a wizard, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d6 per wizard level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: None\nWeapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom\nSkills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus (a) a scholar\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack A spellbook Table- The Wizard\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Spellcasting, Arcane Recovery 3 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Arcane Tradition 3 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 - 3 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 - 4 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Arcane Tradition Feature 4 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 4 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 - 4 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Arcane Tradition Feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Arcane Tradition Feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Spell Mastery 5 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Signature Spell 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Spellcasting # As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.\nCantrips # At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\nSpellbook # At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\nPreparing and Casting Spells # The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you\u0026rsquo;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher # Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the \u0026ldquo;Your Spellbook\u0026rdquo;).\nArcane Recovery # You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example, if you\u0026rsquo;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\nArcane Tradition # When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSpell Mastery # At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.\nSignature Spells # When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can\u0026rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nArcane Traditions # The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.\nSchool of Evocation # You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\nEvocation Savant # Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\nSculpt Spells # Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\nPotent Cantrip # Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip\u0026rsquo;s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\nEmpowered Evocation # Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\nOverchannel # Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.\nYour Spellbook\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard\u0026rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\nReplacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\n*If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\nThe Book\u0026rsquo;s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\nCustomizations # Multiclassing # Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you\u0026rsquo;re a 5th-level character.\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you\u0026rsquo;ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\nPrerequisites # To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.\nTable- Multiclassing Prerequisites\nClass Ability Score Min. Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 Experience Points # The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.\nHit Points and Hit Dice # You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\nProficiency Bonus # Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.\nProficiencies # When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class\u0026rsquo;s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\nTable- Multiclassing Proficiencies\nClass Proficiencies Gained Barbarian Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons Monk Simple weapons, shortswords Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class\u0026rsquo;s skill list Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class\u0026rsquo;s skill list, thieves\u0026rsquo; tools Sorcerer - Warlock Light armor, simple weapons Wizard - Class Features # When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don\u0026rsquo;t, however, receive the class\u0026rsquo;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you\u0026rsquo;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\nChannel Divinity # If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\nExtra Attack # If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don\u0026rsquo;t add together. You can\u0026rsquo;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter\u0026rsquo;s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock\u0026rsquo;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.\nUnarmored Defense # If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t gain it again from another class.\nSpellcasting # Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\nSpells Known and Prepared. You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\nIf a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class\nSpell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don\u0026rsquo;t have any spells of that higher level.\nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don\u0026rsquo;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.\nPact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\nTable- Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level\nLevel 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Feats # A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.\nAt certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat\u0026rsquo;s description says otherwise.\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat\u0026rsquo;s prerequisite, you can\u0026rsquo;t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow-perhaps by a withering curse-you can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.\nGrappler # Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:\nYou have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling. You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends. Personalization # Alignment # A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\nThese brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\nLawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.\nNeutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.\nChaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\nLawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.\nNeutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don\u0026rsquo;t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.\nChaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.\nLawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.\nNeutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.\nChaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.\nAlignment in the Multiverse # For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.\nThe evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god\u0026rsquo;s influence.)\nAlignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.\nMost creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.\nLanguages # Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.\nChoose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM\u0026rsquo;s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves\u0026rsquo; cant or the tongue of druids.\nSome of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.\nTable- Standard Languages\nLanguage Typical Speakers Script Common Humans Common Dwarvish Dwarves Dwarvish Elvish Elves Elvish Giant Ogres, giants Dwarvish Gnomish Gnomes Dwarvish Goblin Goblinoids Dwarvish Halfling Halflings Common Orc Orcs Dwarvish Table- Exotic Languages\nLanguage Typical Speakers Script Abyssal Demons Infernal Celestial Celestials Celestial Draconic Dragons, dragonborn Draconic Deep Speech Aboleths, cloakers - Infernal Devils Infernal Primordial Elementals Dwarvish Sylvan Fey creatures Elvish Undercommon Underworld traders Elvish Inspiration # Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that\u0026rsquo;s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.\nGaining Inspiration # Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.\nYou either have inspiration or you don\u0026rsquo;t - you can\u0026rsquo;t stockpile multiple \u0026ldquo;inspirations\u0026rdquo; for later use.\nUsing Inspiration # If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.\nAdditionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.\nBackgrounds # Every story has a beginning. Your character\u0026rsquo;s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character\u0026rsquo;s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don\u0026rsquo;t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.\nProficiencies # Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in \u0026ldquo;Using Ability Scores\u0026rdquo;).\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in \u0026ldquo;Equipment\u0026rdquo;).\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.\nLanguages # Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See \u0026ldquo;Languages.\u0026rdquo;\nEquipment # Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.\nSuggested Characteristics # A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.\nCustomizing a Background # You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can\u0026rsquo;t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.\nAcolyte # You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \u0026ldquo;Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\u0026rdquo; or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.\nSkill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion\nLanguages: Two of your choice\nEquipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp\nFeature: Shelter of the Faithful # As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\nSuggested Characteristics # Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\nTable- Suggested Acolyte Characteristics\nd8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person\u0026rsquo;s deeds and example. 2 I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. 3 I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen 4 Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. 5 I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. 6 I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods. 7 I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple\u0026rsquo;s elite. Rough living grates on me. 8 I\u0026rsquo;ve spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. d6 Ideal 1 Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful) 2 Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good) 3 Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic) 4 Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith\u0026rsquo;s religious hierarchy. (Lawful) 5 Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful) 6 Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god\u0026rsquo;s favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any) d6 Bond 1 I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago. 2 I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic. 3 I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died. 4 Everything I do is for the common people. 5 I will do anything to protect the temple where I served. 6 I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy. d6 Flaw 1 I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. 2 I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy. 3 My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god. 4 I am inflexible in my thinking. 5 I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them. 6 Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. Equipment # Coinage # Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The old piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\u0026rsquo;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer\u0026rsquo;s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\u0026rsquo;s rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.\nTable- Standard Exchange Rates\nCoin CP SP EP GP PP Copper (cp) 1 1/10 1/50 1/100 1/1,000 Silver (sp) 10 1 1/5 1/10 1/100 Electrum (ep) 50 5 1 1/2 1/20 Gold (gp) 100 10 2 1 1/10 Platinum (pp) 1,000 100 20 10 1 Selling Treasure # Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.\nArms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.\nMagic Items. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn\u0026rsquo;t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won\u0026rsquo;t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.\nGems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.\nTrade Goods. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.\nArmor # Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.\nArmor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor\u0026rsquo;s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells.\nArmor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.\nHeavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer\u0026rsquo;s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \u0026ldquo;Str 13\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Str 15\u0026rdquo; in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer\u0026rsquo;s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\nStealth. If the Armor table shows \u0026ldquo;Disadvantage\u0026rdquo; in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nShields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.\nLight Armor # Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nPadded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.\nLeather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.\nStudded Leather. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.\nMedium Armor # Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nHide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.\nChain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer\u0026rsquo;s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.\nScale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.\nBreastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer\u0026rsquo;s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.\nHalf Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer\u0026rsquo;s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.\nHeavy Armor # Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.\nHeavy armor doesn\u0026rsquo;t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn\u0026rsquo;t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\nRing Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it\u0026rsquo;s usually worn only by those who can\u0026rsquo;t afford better armor.\nChain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.\nSplint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.\nPlate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.\nTable- Armor\nArmor Cost Armor Class (AC) Strength Stealth Weight Light Armor Padded 5 gp 11 + Dex modifier - Disadvantage 8 lb.

Getting Into and Out of Armor # The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor\u0026rsquo;s category.\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor\u0026rsquo;s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.\nDoff. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.\nTable- Donning and Doffing Armor\nCategory Don Doff Light Armor 1 minute 1 minute Medium Armor 5 minutes 1 minute Heavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutes Shield 1 action 1 action Weapons # Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class\u0026rsquo;s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.\nThe Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.\nWeapon Proficiency # Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.\nProficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\nWeapon Properties # Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.\nAmmunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \u0026ldquo;Improvised Weapons\u0026rdquo; later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\nFinesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\nHeavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon\u0026rsquo;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.\nLight. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\nLoading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\nRange. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon\u0026rsquo;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon\u0026rsquo;s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can\u0026rsquo;t attack a target beyond the weapon\u0026rsquo;s long range.\nReach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter ##).\nSpecial. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon\u0026rsquo;s description (see \u0026ldquo;Special Weapons\u0026rdquo; later in this section).\nThrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.\nTwo-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\nVersatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\nImprovised Weapons # Sometimes characters don\u0026rsquo;t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\nOften, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nSilvered Weapons # Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.\nSpecial Weapons # Weapons with special rules are described here.\nLance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren\u0026rsquo;t mounted.\nNet. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.\nWhen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\nTable- Weapons\nName Cost Damage Weight Properties Simple Melee Weapons Club 1 sp 1d4 bludgeoning 2 lb.

As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.\nAlchemist\u0026rsquo;s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist\u0026rsquo;s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\nAntitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.\nArcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item- designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.\nBall Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to make the save.\nBlock and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.\nBook. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).\nCaltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature\u0026rsquo;s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to make the save.\nCandle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\nCase, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.\nCase, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.\nChain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.\nClimber\u0026rsquo;s Kit. A climber\u0026rsquo;s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber\u0026rsquo;s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can\u0026rsquo;t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can\u0026rsquo;t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.\nComponent Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell\u0026rsquo;s description).\nCrowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar\u0026rsquo;s leverage can be applied.\nDruidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.\nFishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer\u0026rsquo;s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nHoly Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \u0026ldquo;Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\u0026rdquo; lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.\nHoly Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.\nHunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.\nLamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\nLock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.\nMagnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.\nManacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can pick the manacles\u0026rsquo; lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.\nMess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.\nOil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.\nPoison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.\nPotion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.\nPouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.\nRations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.\nRope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.\nScale, Merchant\u0026rsquo;s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.\nSpellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.\nSpyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.\nTent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.\nTinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.\nTorch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.\nEquipment Packs\nThe starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.\nBurglar\u0026rsquo;s Pack (16 gp). Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin.

Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10 candles, a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a censer, vestments, 2 days of rations, and a waterskin.\nScholar\u0026rsquo;s Pack (40 gp).

Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver\u0026rsquo;s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.\nTable- Tools\nItem Cost Weight Artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools ~ Alchemist\u0026rsquo;s supplies 50 gp 8 lb. ~ Brewer\u0026rsquo;s supplies 20 gp 9 lb. ~ Calligrapher\u0026rsquo;s supplies 10 gp 5 lb. ~ Carpenter\u0026rsquo;s tools 8 gp 6 lb. ~ Cartographer\u0026rsquo;s tools 15 gp 6 lb. ~ Cobbler\u0026rsquo;s tools 5 gp 5 lb. ~ Cook\u0026rsquo;s utensils 1 gp 8 lb. ~ Glassblower\u0026rsquo;s tools 30 gp 5 lb. ~ Jeweler\u0026rsquo;s tools 25 gp 2 lb. ~ Leatherworker\u0026rsquo;s tools 5 gp 5 lb. ~ Mason\u0026rsquo;s tools 10 gp 8 lb. ~ Painter\u0026rsquo;s supplies 10 gp 5 lb. ~ Potter\u0026rsquo;s tools 10 gp 3 lb. ~ Smith\u0026rsquo;s tools 20 gp 8 lb. ~ Tinker\u0026rsquo;s tools 50 gp 10 lb. ~ Weaver\u0026rsquo;s tools 1 gp 5 lb. ~ Woodcarver\u0026rsquo;s tools 1 gp 5 lb.

Vehicles (land or water) * * * See the \u0026ldquo;Mounts and Vehicles\u0026rdquo; section.\nArtisan\u0026rsquo;s Tools. These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools requires a separate proficiency.\nDisguise Kit. This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.\nForgery Kit. This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.\nGaming Set. This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.\nHerbalism Kit. This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.\nMusical Instrument. Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.\nNavigator\u0026rsquo;s Tools. This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator\u0026rsquo;s tools lets you chart a ship\u0026rsquo;s course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.\nPoisoner\u0026rsquo;s Kit. A poisoner\u0026rsquo;s kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.\nThieves\u0026rsquo; Tools. This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks.\nMounts and Vehicles # A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal\u0026rsquo;s speed and base carrying capacity.\nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.\nMounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.\nBarding. Barding is armor designed to protect an animal\u0026rsquo;s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.\nSaddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.\nVehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.\nRowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can\u0026rsquo;t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.\nTable- Mounts and Other Animals\nItem Cost Speed Carrying Capacity Camel 50 gp 50 ft. 480 lb. Donkey or mule 8 gp 40 ft. 420 lb.

It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).\nGuilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.\nTable- Cost of Trade Goods\nCost Goods 1 cp 1 lb. of wheat 2 cp 1 lb. of flour or one chicken 5 cp 1 lb. of salt 1 sp 1 lb. of iron or 1 sq. yd. of canvas 5 sp 1 lb. of copper or 1 sq. yd. of cotton cloth 1 gp 1 lb. of ginger or one goat 2 gp 1 lb. of cinnamon or pepper, or one sheep 3 gp 1 lb. of cloves or one pig 5 gp 1 lb. of silver or 1 sq. yd. of linen 10 gp 1 sq. yd. of silk or one cow 15 gp 1 lb. of saffron or one ox 50 gp 1 lb. of gold 500 gp 1 lb. of platinum Expenses # When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.\nLifestyle Expenses # Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\nAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character\u0026rsquo;s career.\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\nTable- Lifestyle Expenses\nLifestyle Price/Day Wretched - Squalid 1 sp Poor 2 sp Modest 1 gp Comfortable 2 gp Wealthy 4 gp Aristocratic 10 gp minimum Wretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\nSqualid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.\nPoor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\nModest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don\u0026rsquo;t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\nComfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\nWealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\nAristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\nFood, Drink, and Lodging # The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night\u0026rsquo;s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.\nTable- Food, Drink, and Lodging\nItem Cost Ale ~ Gallon 2 sp ~ Mug 4 cp ~ Banquet (per person) 10 gp ~ Bread, loaf 2 cp ~ Cheese, hunk 1 sp Inn stay (per day) ~ Squalid 7 cp ~ Poor 1 sp ~ Modest 5 sp ~ Comfortable 8 sp ~ Wealthy 2 gp ~ Aristocratic 4 gp Meals (per day) ~ Squalid 3 cp ~ Poor 6 cp ~ Modest 3 sp ~ Comfortable 5 sp ~ Wealthy 8 sp ~ Aristocratic 2 gp ~ Meat, chunk 3 sp Wine ~ Common (pitcher) 2 sp ~ Fine (bottle) 10 gp Self-Sufficiency\nThe expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\nMaintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\nServices # Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\nSkilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.\nTable- Services\nService Pay Pay Coach cab ~ Between towns 3 cp per mile ~ Within a city 1 cp Hireling ~ Skilled 2 gp per day ~ Untrained 2 sp per day Messenger 2 cp per mile Road or gate toll 1 cp Ship\u0026rsquo;s passage 1 sp per mile Spellcasting Services # People who are able to cast spells don\u0026rsquo;t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\nHiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.\nAbilities # Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature\u0026rsquo;s physical and mental characteristics:\nStrength, measuring physical power Dexterity, measuring agility Constitution, measuring endurance Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory Wisdom, measuring perception and insight Charisma, measuring force of personality Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature\u0026rsquo;s assets as well as weaknesses.\nThe three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book\u0026rsquo;s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\nAbility Scores and Modifiers # Each of a creature\u0026rsquo;s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature\u0026rsquo;s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\nTable- Ability Scores and Modifiers\nScore Modifier 1 -5 2-3 -4 4-5 -3 6-7 -2 8-9 -1 10-11 +0 12-13 +1 14-15 +2 16-17 +3 18-19 +4 20-21 +5 22-23 +6 24-25 +7 26-27 +8 28-29 +9 30 +10 To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\nAdvantage and Disadvantage # Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don\u0026rsquo;t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling\u0026rsquo;s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The\nGM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\nProficiency Bonus # Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\nYour proficiency bonus can\u0026rsquo;t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue\u0026rsquo;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don\u0026rsquo;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\nIn general, you don\u0026rsquo;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\nAbility Checks # An ability check tests a character\u0026rsquo;s or monster\u0026rsquo;s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.\nThe more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\nTable- Difficulty Classes\nTask Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\nContests # Sometimes one character\u0026rsquo;s or monster\u0026rsquo;s efforts are directly opposed to another\u0026rsquo;s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal- for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\nSkills # Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual\u0026rsquo;s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character\u0026rsquo;s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster\u0026rsquo;s skill proficiencies appear in the monster\u0026rsquo;s stat block.)\nFor example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character\u0026rsquo;s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability\u0026rsquo;s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\nTable- Related Skills\nStrength Dexterity Intelligence Wisdom Charisma Athletics Acrobatics Arcana Animal Handling Deception Sleight of Hand History Insight Intimidation Stealth Investigation Medicine Performance Nature Perception Persuasion Religion Survival Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, \u0026ldquo;Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.\u0026rdquo; At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character\u0026rsquo;s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\nVariant: Skills with Different Abilities # Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\nPassive Checks # A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to determine a character\u0026rsquo;s total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\nThe rules on hiding in the \u0026ldquo;Dexterity\u0026rdquo; section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\nWorking Together # Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who\u0026rsquo;s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can\u0026rsquo;t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\nGroup Checks # When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren\u0026rsquo;t.\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\nGroup checks don\u0026rsquo;t come up very often, and they\u0026rsquo;re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\nUsing Each Ability # Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\nStrength # Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\nStrength Checks # A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\nYou attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off. You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump. You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming. Other Strength Checks. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nForce open a stuck, locked, or barred door Break free of bonds Push through a tunnel that is too small Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it Tip over a statue Keep a boulder from rolling Attack Rolls and Damage # You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\nLifting and Carrying # Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don\u0026rsquo;t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature\u0026rsquo;s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\nVariant: Encumbrance # The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\nDexterity # Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\nDexterity Checks # A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship\u0026rsquo;s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person\u0026rsquo;s pocket.\nStealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nControl a heavily laden cart on a steep descent Steer a chariot around a tight turn Pick a lock Disable a trap Securely tie up a prisoner Wriggle free of bonds Play a stringed instrument Craft a small or detailed object Attack Rolls and Damage # You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\nArmor Class # Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\nInitiative # At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures\u0026rsquo; turns in combat.\nHiding\nThe DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check\u0026rsquo;s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception. When you hide, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren\u0026rsquo;t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature\u0026rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature\u0026rsquo;s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in the \u0026ldquo;Adventuring\u0026rdquo; section.\nConstitution # Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\nConstitution Checks # Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\nThe GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nHold your breath March or labor for hours without rest Go without sleep Survive without food or water Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go Hit Points # Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you\u0026rsquo;re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\nIntelligence # Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\nIntelligence Checks # An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nCommunicate with a creature without using words Estimate the value of a precious item Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard Forge a document Recall lore about a craft or trade Win a game of skill Spellcasting Ability # Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nWisdom # Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\nWisdom Checks # A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone\u0026rsquo;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal\u0026rsquo;s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone\u0026rsquo;s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nGet a gut feeling about what course of action to follow Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead Spellcasting Ability # Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nCharisma # Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\nCharisma Checks # A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone\u0026rsquo;s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\nIntimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nFind the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation Spellcasting Ability # Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nSaving Throws # A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don\u0026rsquo;t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.\nTo make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\nA saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.\nEach class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.\nThe Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster\u0026rsquo;s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.\nThe result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\nAdventuring # Time # In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers\u0026rsquo; movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours\u0026rsquo; time.\nFor long journeys, a scale of days works best.\nFollowing the road from Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time.\nMovement # Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.\nThe GM can summarize the adventurers\u0026rsquo; movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \u0026ldquo;You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\u0026rdquo; Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: \u0026ldquo;After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\u0026rdquo;\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they\u0026rsquo;re moving over.\nSpeed # Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nTravel Pace # While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix ##).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don\u0026rsquo;t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\nTable- Travel Pace\nDistance Traveled Per \u0026hellip;\nPace Minute Hour Day Effect Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores Normal 300 feet 3 miles 18 miles - Slow 200 feet 2 miles 24 miles Able to use stealth Difficult Terrain # The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult terrain.\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain- moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nSpecial Types of Movement # Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\nClimbing, Swimming, and Crawling # While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\nJumping # Your Strength determines how far you can jump.\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM\u0026rsquo;s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump\u0026rsquo;s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.\nThe Environment # By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.\nFalling # A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\nSuffocating # A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can\u0026rsquo;t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\nVision and Light # The most fundamental tasks of adventuring- noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character\u0026rsquo;s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\nA heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix ##) when trying to see something in that area.\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\nBright light lets most creatures see normally.\nEven gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area.\nCharacters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\nBlindsight # A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\nDarkvision # Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nTruesight # A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\nFood and Water # Characters who don\u0026rsquo;t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix ##). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can\u0026rsquo;t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\nFood # A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\nWater # A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\nInteracting with Objects # A character\u0026rsquo;s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It\u0026rsquo;s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\nResting # Heroic though they might be, adventurers can\u0026rsquo;t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\nAdventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\nShort Rest # A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character\u0026rsquo;s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character\u0026rsquo;s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character\u0026rsquo;s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.\nLong Rest # A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character\u0026rsquo;s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.\nA character can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\nBetween Adventures # Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\nLifestyle Expenses # Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\nDowntime Activities # Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\nCrafting # You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith\u0026rsquo;s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5 gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\nPracticing a Profession # You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\nIf you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves\u0026rsquo; guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\nRecuperating # You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\nEnd one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points. For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you. Researching # The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone\u0026rsquo;s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\nFor each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\nTraining # You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.\nCombat # A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\nCombat Step by Step # Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. Establish positions. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers\u0026rsquo; marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants\u0026rsquo; turns. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops. Surprise # A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn\u0026rsquo;t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re surprised, you can\u0026rsquo;t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can\u0026rsquo;t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren\u0026rsquo;t.\nInitiative # Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\nYour Turn # On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed- sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet.\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the \u0026ldquo;Actions in Combat\u0026rdquo; section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Movement and Position\u0026rdquo; section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can\u0026rsquo;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in \u0026ldquo;Actions in Combat.\u0026rdquo;\nBonus Actions # Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don\u0026rsquo;t have a bonus action to take.\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action\u0026rsquo;s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\nOther Activity on Your Turn # Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\nReactions # Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else\u0026rsquo;s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\nWhen you take a reaction, you can\u0026rsquo;t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature\u0026rsquo;s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\nMovement and Position # In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you\u0026rsquo;re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\nBreaking Up Your Move # You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\nMoving between Attacks # If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.\nUsing Different Speeds # If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you\u0026rsquo;ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can\u0026rsquo;t use the new speed during the current move.\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\nDifficult Terrain # Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\nBeing Prone # Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.\nYou can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend\n15 feet of movement to stand up. You can\u0026rsquo;t stand up if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\nTo move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\nInteracting with Objects Around You\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:\ndraw or sheathe a sword open or close a door withdraw a potion from your backpack pick up a dropped axe take a bauble from a table remove a ring from your finger stuff some food into your mouth plant a banner in the ground fish a few coins from your belt pouch drink all the ale in a flagon throw a lever or a switch pull a torch from a sconce take a book from a shelf you can reach extinguish a small flame don a mask pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head put your ear to a door kick a small stone turn a key in a lock tap the floor with a 10-foot pole hand an item to another character Moving Around Other Creatures # You can move through a nonhostile creature\u0026rsquo;s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature\u0026rsquo;s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature\u0026rsquo;s space is difficult terrain for you.\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can\u0026rsquo;t willingly end your move in its space.\nIf you leave a hostile creature\u0026rsquo;s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.\nFlying Movement # Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.\nCreature Size # Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\nTable- Creature Size\nSize Space Tiny 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft. Small 5 by 5 ft. Medium 5 by 5 ft. Large 10 by 10 ft. Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger Space # A creature\u0026rsquo;s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn\u0026rsquo;t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway, other creatures can\u0026rsquo;t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\nA creature\u0026rsquo;s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there\u0026rsquo;s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there\u0026rsquo;s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space # A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that\u0026rsquo;s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it\u0026rsquo;s in the smaller space.\nActions in Combat # When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\nAttack # The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \u0026ldquo;Making an Attack\u0026rdquo; section for the rules that govern attacks.\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\nCast a Spell # Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\nDash # When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\nDisengage # If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn\u0026rsquo;t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\nDodge # When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.\nHelp # You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally\u0026rsquo;s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\nHide # When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \u0026ldquo;Unseen Attackers and Targets\u0026rdquo; section later in this chapter.\nReady # Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \u0026ldquo;If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I\u0026rsquo;ll pull the lever that opens it,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell\u0026rsquo;s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\nSearch # When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nUse an Object # You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.\nMaking an Attack # Whether you\u0026rsquo;re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.\nChoose a target. Pick a target within your attack\u0026rsquo;s Range: a creature, an object, or a location. Determine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage. If there\u0026rsquo;s ever any question whether something you\u0026rsquo;re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you\u0026rsquo;re making an attack roll, you\u0026rsquo;re making an attack.\nAttack Rolls # When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\nModifiers to the Roll # When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character\u0026rsquo;s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\nAbility Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\nSome spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\nProficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.\nRolling 1 or 20 # Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target\u0026rsquo;s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target\u0026rsquo;s AC.\nUnseen Attackers and Targets # Combatants often try to escape their foes\u0026rsquo; notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\nWhen you attack a target that you can\u0026rsquo;t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you\u0026rsquo;re guessing the target\u0026rsquo;s location or you\u0026rsquo;re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn\u0026rsquo;t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target\u0026rsquo;s location correctly.\nWhen a creature can\u0026rsquo;t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\nRanged Attacks # When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\nRange # You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can\u0026rsquo;t attack a target beyond this range.\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can\u0026rsquo;t attack a target beyond the long range.\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat # Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated.\nMelee Attacks # Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\nContests in Combat\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\nOpportunity Attacks # In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don\u0026rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don\u0026rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe\u0026rsquo;s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting # When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you\u0026rsquo;re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you\u0026rsquo;re holding in the other hand. You don\u0026rsquo;t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\nGrappling # When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target\u0026rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix ##). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\nShoving a Creature # Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target\u0026rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.\nCover # Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren\u0026rsquo;t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\nA target with total cover can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\nDamage and Healing # Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\nHit Points # Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\nA creature\u0026rsquo;s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature\u0026rsquo;s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\nDamage Rolls # Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\nWhen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball or a cleric casts flame strike, the spell\u0026rsquo;s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\nCritical Hits # When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue\u0026rsquo;s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\nDamage Types # Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil\u0026rsquo;s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters\u0026rsquo; bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer\u0026rsquo;s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric\u0026rsquo;s flame strike spell or an angel\u0026rsquo;s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters\u0026rsquo; claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability # Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\nHealing # Unless it results in death, damage isn\u0026rsquo;t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points can\u0026rsquo;t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can\u0026rsquo;t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\nDropping to 0 Hit Points # When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\nInstant Death # Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\nFalling Unconscious # If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix ##). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\nDeath Saving Throws # Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\nStabilizing a Creature # The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn\u0026rsquo;t killed by a failed death saving throw.\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA stable creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn\u0026rsquo;t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\nMonsters and Death # Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\nKnocking a Creature Out # Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\nTemporary Hit Points # Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren\u0026rsquo;t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can\u0026rsquo;t restore temporary hit points, and they can\u0026rsquo;t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn\u0026rsquo;t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you\u0026rsquo;re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they\u0026rsquo;re depleted or you finish a long rest.\nMounted Combat # A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.\nA willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\nMounting and Dismounting # Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can\u0026rsquo;t mount it if you don\u0026rsquo;t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you\u0026rsquo;re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you\u0026rsquo;re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\nControlling a Mount # While you\u0026rsquo;re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you\u0026rsquo;re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.\nUnderwater Combat # When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.\nWhen making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\nA ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon\u0026rsquo;s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.\nSpellcasting # Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.\nThis chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.\nWhat Is a Spell? # A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.\nSpells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix ##), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.\nUncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse\u0026rsquo;s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\nSpell Level # Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell\u0026rsquo;s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell\u0026rsquo;s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\nSpell level and character level don\u0026rsquo;t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\nKnown and Prepared Spells # Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character\u0026rsquo;s level.\nSpell Slots # Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class\u0026rsquo;s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher, effectively \u0026ldquo;filling\u0026rdquo; a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level # When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\nSome spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell\u0026rsquo;s description.\nCasting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\nCantrips # A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster\u0026rsquo;s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip\u0026rsquo;s spell level is 0.\nRituals # Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can\u0026rsquo;t be cast at a higher level.\nTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character\u0026rsquo;s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard\u0026rsquo;s does.\nThe Schools of Magic\nAcademies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.\nThe schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.\nAbjuration spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.\nConjuration spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster\u0026rsquo;s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.\nDivination spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.\nEnchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.\nEvocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.\nIllusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.\nNecromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.\nCreating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.\nTransmutation spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster\u0026rsquo;s command, or enhance a creature\u0026rsquo;s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.\nCasting a Spell # When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character\u0026rsquo;s class or the spell\u0026rsquo;s effects.\nEach spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell\u0026rsquo;s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect.\nCasting Time # Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\nBonus Action # A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven\u0026rsquo;t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can\u0026rsquo;t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\nReactions # Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\nLonger Casting Times # Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see \u0026ldquo;Concentration\u0026rdquo; below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don\u0026rsquo;t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\nSpell Range # The target of a spell must be within the spell\u0026rsquo;s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect must be you (see \u0026ldquo;Areas of Effect\u0026rdquo; later in the this chapter).\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren\u0026rsquo;t limited by its range, unless the spell\u0026rsquo;s description says otherwise.\nComponents # A spell\u0026rsquo;s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell\u0026rsquo;s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can\u0026rsquo;t provide one or more of a spell\u0026rsquo;s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\nVerbal (V) # Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren\u0026rsquo;t the source of the spell\u0026rsquo;s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can\u0026rsquo;t cast a spell with a verbal component.\nSomatic (S) # Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\nMaterial (M) # Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in \u0026ldquo;Equipment\u0026rdquo;) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\nIf a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell\u0026rsquo;s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\nDuration # A spell\u0026rsquo;s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\nInstantaneous # Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can\u0026rsquo;t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\nConcentration # Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\nCasting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can\u0026rsquo;t concentrate on two spells at once. Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage. Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die. The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you\u0026rsquo;re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\nTargets # A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell\u0026rsquo;s magic. A spell\u0026rsquo;s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\nA Clear Path to the Target # To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can\u0026rsquo;t be behind total cover.\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you can\u0026rsquo;t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\nTargeting Yourself # If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\nAreas of Effect # Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\nA spell\u0026rsquo;s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell\u0026rsquo;s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\nA spell\u0026rsquo;s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn\u0026rsquo;t included in the spell\u0026rsquo;s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\nCone # A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone\u0026rsquo;s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point\u0026rsquo;s distance from the point of origin. A cone\u0026rsquo;s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\nA cone\u0026rsquo;s point of origin is not included in the cone\u0026rsquo;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nCube # You select a cube\u0026rsquo;s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube\u0026rsquo;s size is expressed as the length of each side.\nA cube\u0026rsquo;s point of origin is not included in the cube\u0026rsquo;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nCylinder # A cylinder\u0026rsquo;s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell\u0026rsquo;s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\nA cylinder\u0026rsquo;s point of origin is included in the cylinder\u0026rsquo;s area of effect.\nLine # A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\nA line\u0026rsquo;s point of origin is not included in the line\u0026rsquo;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nSphere # You select a sphere\u0026rsquo;s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere\u0026rsquo;s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.\nA sphere\u0026rsquo;s point of origin is included in the sphere\u0026rsquo;s area of effect.\nSpell Saving Throws # Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell\u0026rsquo;s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\nThe DC to resist one of your spells = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\nSpell Attack Rolls # Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated.\nCombining Magical Effects # The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don\u0026rsquo;t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\nFor example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell\u0026rsquo;s benefit only once; he or she doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to roll two bonus dice.\nSpells #

Acid Arrow # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder\u0026rsquo;s stomach)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.\nAcid Splash # Conjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature you can see within range, or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).\nAid # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYour spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target\u0026rsquo;s hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.\nAlarm # 1st-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won\u0026rsquo;t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.\nA mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.\nAn audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.\nAlter Self # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.\nAquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\nChange Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can\u0026rsquo;t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you\u0026rsquo;re bipedal, you can\u0026rsquo;t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.\nNatural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.\nAnimal Friendship # 1st-­level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a morsel of food)\nDuration: 24 hours\nThis spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast\u0026rsquo;s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast t level above 1st.\nAnimal Messenger # 2nd-level enchantment (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a morsel of food)\nDuration: 24 hours\nBy means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as \u0026ldquo;a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.\u0026rdquo; You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.\nWhen the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn\u0026rsquo;t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.\nAnimal Shapes # 8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 24 hours\nYour magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target\u0026rsquo;s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the creature\u0026rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u0026rsquo;t speak or cast spells.\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s gear melds into the new form. The target can\u0026rsquo;t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nAnimate Dead # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature\u0026rsquo;s game statistics).\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you\u0026rsquo;ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.\nAnimate Objects # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nObjects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can\u0026rsquo;t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.\nAs a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\nTable- Animate Object Stats\nSize HP AC Attack Str Dex Tiny 20 18 +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage 4 18 Small 25 16 +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage 6 14 Medium 40 13 +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage 10 12 Large 50 10 +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage 14 10 Huge 80 10 +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage 18 6 An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is\n30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.\nAntilife Shell # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.\nThe barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.\nIf you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.\nAntimagic Field # 8th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA 10-foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can\u0026rsquo;t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u0026rsquo;t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u0026rsquo;t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon\u0026rsquo;s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don\u0026rsquo;t nullify each other.\nAntipathy/Sympathy # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)\nDuration: 10 days\nThis spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura\u0026rsquo;s effect.\nAntipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can\u0026rsquo;t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can\u0026rsquo;t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\nSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move away from the target.\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\nEnding the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\nArcane Eye # 4th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can\u0026rsquo;t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye\u0026rsquo;s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.\nArcane Hand # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.\nThe hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn\u0026rsquo;t fill its space.\nWhen you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.\nClenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.\nForceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.\nMake a check with the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\nGrasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nInterposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can\u0026rsquo;t move through the hand\u0026rsquo;s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand\u0026rsquo;s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.\nArcane Lock # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.\nWhile affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.\nArcane Sword # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.\nWhen the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.\nArcanist\u0026rsquo;s Magic Aura # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a small square of silk)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn\u0026rsquo;t being carried or worn by another creature.\nWhen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.\nFalse Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object\u0026rsquo;s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.\nMask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin\u0026rsquo;s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.\nAstral Projection # 9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Special\nYou and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need food or air and doesn\u0026rsquo;t age.\nYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.\nThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature\u0026rsquo;s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature\u0026rsquo;s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.\nAugury # 2nd-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBy casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:\nWeal, for good results Woe, for bad results Weal and woe, for both good and bad results Nothing, for results that aren\u0026rsquo;t especially good or bad The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.\nAwaken # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 8 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAfter spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human\u0026rsquo;s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.\nThe awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.\nSpells (B) # Bane # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nUp to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.\nBanishment # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.\nIf the target is native to the plane of existence you\u0026rsquo;re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nIf the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you\u0026rsquo;re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn\u0026rsquo;t return.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.\nBarkskin # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target\u0026rsquo;s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target\u0026rsquo;s AC can\u0026rsquo;t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.\nBeacon of Hope # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThis spell bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.\nBestow Curse # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:\nChoose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing. While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse\u0026rsquo;s effect.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require concentration.\nBlack Tentacles # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nSquirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.\nWhen a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.\nA creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.\nBlade Barrier # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.\nWhen a creature enters the wall\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.\nBless # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.\nBlight # 4th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nNecromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn\u0026rsquo;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\nBlindness/Deafness # 2nd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.\nBlink # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nRoll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can\u0026rsquo;t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren\u0026rsquo;t there can\u0026rsquo;t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.\nBlur # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYour body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.\nBranding Smite # 2nd-­level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThe next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it\u0026rsquo;s invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-­foot radius and can\u0026rsquo;t become invisible until the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\nBurning Hands # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAs you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\nSpells (C) # Call Lightning # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can\u0026rsquo;t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can\u0026rsquo;t accommodate the cloud).\nWhen you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.\nIf you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d10.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.\nCalm Emotions # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.\nYou can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.\nAlternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.\nChain Lightning # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.\nA target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each slot level above 6th.\nCharm Person # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.\nChill Touch # Necromancy cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nYou create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can\u0026rsquo;t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.\nIf you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nCircle of Death # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.\nClairvoyance # 3rd-level divination\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 1 mile\nComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can\u0026rsquo;t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.\nA creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.\nClone # 8th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.\nAt any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return.\nThe clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original\u0026rsquo;s equipment. The original creature\u0026rsquo;s physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can\u0026rsquo;t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is elsewhere.\nCloudkill # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a 20-foot radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.\nWhen a creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe.\nThe fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\nColor Spray # 1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)\nDuration: 1 round\nA dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t see).\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.\nCommand # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 round\nYou speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.\nSome typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can\u0026rsquo;t follow your command, the spell ends.\nApproach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.\nDrop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.\nFlee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.\nGrovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.\nHalt. The target doesn\u0026rsquo;t move and takes no actions.\nA flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.\nCommune # 5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.\nDivine beings aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive \u0026ldquo;unclear\u0026rdquo; as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity\u0026rsquo;s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity\u0026rsquo;s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.\nCommune with Nature # 5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:\nterrain and bodies of water prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead influence from other planes of existence buildings For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.\nComprehend Languages # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)\nDuration: 1 hour\nFor the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.\nThis spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn\u0026rsquo;t part of a written language.\nCompulsion # 4th-­level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nCreatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect.\nA target isn\u0026rsquo;t compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.\nCone of Cold # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\nConfusion # 4th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (three nut shells)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThis spell assaults and twists creatures\u0026rsquo; minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.\nAn affected target can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\nTable- Confusion Behavior\nd10 Behavior 1 The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t take an action this turn. 2-6 The creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t move or take actions this turn. 7-8 The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. 9-10 The creature can act and move normally. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.\nConjure Animals # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:\nOne beast of challenge rating 2 or lower Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u0026rsquo;t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.\nThe GM has the creatures\u0026rsquo; statistics.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.\nConjure Celestial # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon a celestial of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The celestial disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe celestial is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the celestial, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don\u0026rsquo;t violate its alignment. If you don\u0026rsquo;t issue any commands to the celestial, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\nThe GM has the celestial\u0026rsquo;s statistics.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you summon a celestial of challenge rating 5 or lower.\nConjure Elemental # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don\u0026rsquo;t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\nIf your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can\u0026rsquo;t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\nThe GM has the elemental\u0026rsquo;s statistics.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.\nConjure Fey # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey spirit that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower.

Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled fey creature can\u0026rsquo;t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\nThe GM has the fey creature\u0026rsquo;s statistics.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.\nConjure Minor Elementals # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range.

When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.\nContact Other Plane # 5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can\u0026rsquo;t take actions, can\u0026rsquo;t understand what other creatures say, can\u0026rsquo;t read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect.\nOn a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as \u0026ldquo;yes,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;no,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;maybe,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;never,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;irrelevant,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;unclear\u0026rdquo; (if the entity doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.\nContagion # 5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch Component: V, S\nDuration: 7 days\nYour touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is poisoned.\nAt the end of each of the poisoned target\u0026rsquo;s turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration.\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease\u0026rsquo;s effects apply to it.\nBlinding Sickness. Pain grips the creature\u0026rsquo;s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\nFilth Fever. A raging fever sweeps through the creature\u0026rsquo;s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.\nFlesh Rot. The creature\u0026rsquo;s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.\nMindfire. The creature\u0026rsquo;s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.\nSeizure. The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.\nSlimy Doom. The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.\nContingency # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 10 days\nChoose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.\nThe contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.\nThe contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.\nContinual Flame # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nA flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn\u0026rsquo;t use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.\nControl Water # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave\u0026rsquo;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell\u0026rsquo;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell\u0026rsquo;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn\u0026rsquo;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\nControl Weather # 8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\nYou take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.\nWhen you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.\nWhen you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.\nTable- Control Weather (Precipitation)\nStage Condition 1 Clear 2 Light clouds 3 Overcast or ground fog 4 Rain, hail, or snow 5 Torrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard Table- Control Weather (Temperature)\nStage Condition 1 Unbearable heat 2 Hot 3 Warm 4 Cool 5 Cold 6 Arctic cold Table- Control Weather (Wind)\nStage Condition 1 Calm 2 Moderate wind 3 Strong wind 4 Gale 5 Storm Counterspell # 3rd-­level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. On a success, the creature\u0026rsquo;s spell fails and has no effect.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.\nCreate Food and Water # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn\u0026rsquo;t go bad.\nCreate or Destroy Water # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou either create or destroy water.\nCreate Water. You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.\nDestroy Water. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.\nCreate Undead # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.\nCreation # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)\nDuration: Special\nYou pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within Range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object\u0026rsquo;s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nTable- Creation Duration\nMaterial Duration Vegetable matter 1 day Stone or crystal 12 hours Precious metals 1 hour Gems 10 minutes Adamantine or mithral 1 minute Using any material created by this spell as another spell\u0026rsquo;s material component causes that spell to fail.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.\nCure Wounds # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\nSpells (D) # Dancing Lights # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell\u0026rsquo;s range.\nDarkness # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nMagical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can\u0026rsquo;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can\u0026rsquo;t illuminate it.\nIf the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.\nIf any of this spell\u0026rsquo;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\nDarkvision # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\nDaylight # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nA 60-foot radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\nIf any of this spell\u0026rsquo;s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\nDeath Ward # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.\nThe first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.\nIf the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.\nDelayed Blast Fireball # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.\nIf the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.\nThe fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.\nDemiplane # 8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.\nEach time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.\nDetect Evil and Good # 1st-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDetect Magic # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDetect Poison and Disease # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a yew leaf)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDetect Thoughts # 2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a copper piece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nFor the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.\nYou initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature\u0026rsquo;s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature\u0026rsquo;s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.\nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can\u0026rsquo;t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can\u0026rsquo;t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak any language.\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can\u0026rsquo;t see it, but it must still be within range.\nDimension Door # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as \u0026ldquo;200 feet straight downward\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.\u0026rdquo;\nYou can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\u0026rsquo;t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.\nIf you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.\nDisguise Self # 1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou make yourself-including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person- look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can\u0026rsquo;t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\nDisintegrate # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.\nA creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.\nA disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.\nThis spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.\nDispel Evil and Good # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nShimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\nYou can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.\nBreak Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.\nDismissal. As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn\u0026rsquo;t there already). If they aren\u0026rsquo;t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.\nDispel Magic # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nChoose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell\u0026rsquo;s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.\nDivination # 4th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYour magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god\u0026rsquo;s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\nThe spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.\nDivine Favor # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYour prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the spell ends, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.\nDivine Word # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:\n50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn\u0026rsquo;t there already) and can\u0026rsquo;t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a wish spell. Dominate Beast # 4th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.\nWhile the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \u0026ldquo;Attack that creature,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run over there,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Fetch that object.\u0026rdquo; If the creature completes the order and doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything that you don\u0026rsquo;t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.\nDominate Monster # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.\nWhile the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \u0026ldquo;Attack that creature,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run over there,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Fetch that object.\u0026rdquo; If the creature completes the order and doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything that you don\u0026rsquo;t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.\nDominate Person # 5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.\nWhile the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \u0026ldquo;Attack that creature,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run over there,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Fetch that object.\u0026rdquo; If the creature completes the order and doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything that you don\u0026rsquo;t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.\nDream # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Special\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)\nDuration: 8 hours\nThis spell shapes a creature\u0026rsquo;s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t sleep, such as elves, can\u0026rsquo;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can\u0026rsquo;t take actions or move.\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target\u0026rsquo;s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target\u0026rsquo;s dreams.\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target\u0026rsquo;s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target\u0026rsquo;s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.\nDruidcraft # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWhispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:\nYou create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round. You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom. You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube. You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. Spells (E) # Earthquake # 8th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.\nThe ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.\nEach creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\u0026rsquo;s concentration is broken.\nWhen you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.\nThis spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.\nFissures. Fissures open throughout the spell\u0026rsquo;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell\u0026rsquo;s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure\u0026rsquo;s edge as it opens.\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).\nStructures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure\u0026rsquo;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall prone or become buried.\nEldritch Blast # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.\nThe spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.\nEnhance Ability # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour.\nYou touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.\nBear\u0026rsquo;s Endurance. The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.\nBull\u0026rsquo;s Strength. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.\nCat\u0026rsquo;s Grace. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated.\nEagle\u0026rsquo;s Splendor. The target has advantage on Charisma checks.\nFox\u0026rsquo;s Cunning. The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.\nOwl\u0026rsquo;s Wisdom. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.\nEnlarge/Reduce # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.\nIf the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.\nEnlarge. The target\u0026rsquo;s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u0026rsquo;s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target\u0026rsquo;s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.\nReduce. The target\u0026rsquo;s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category-from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u0026rsquo;s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target\u0026rsquo;s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can\u0026rsquo;t reduce the damage below 1).\nEntangle # 1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nGrasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.\nA creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.\nWhen the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.\nEnthrall # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.\nEtherealness # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 8 hours\nYou step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can\u0026rsquo;t see anything more than 60 feet away.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren\u0026rsquo;t on the Ethereal Plane can\u0026rsquo;t perceive you and can\u0026rsquo;t interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.\nYou ignore all objects and effects that aren\u0026rsquo;t on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.\nWhen the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.\nThis spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn\u0026rsquo;t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.\nExpeditious Retreat # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nThis spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take the Dash action.\nEyebite # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nFor the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can\u0026rsquo;t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.\nAsleep. The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.\nPanicked. The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.\nSickened. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.\nSpells (F) # Fabricate # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.\nChoose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.\nCreatures or magic items can\u0026rsquo;t be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can\u0026rsquo;t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools used to craft such objects.\nFaerie Fire # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nEach object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAny attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from being invisible.\nFaithful Hound # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.\nThe hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can\u0026rsquo;t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.\nAt the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound\u0026rsquo;s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.\nFalse Life # 1st-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)\nDuration: 1 hour\nBolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.\nFear # 3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (30-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou project a phantasmal image of a creature\u0026rsquo;s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.\nWhile frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\nFeather Fall # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a small feather or piece of down)\nDuration: 1 minute\nChoose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature\u0026rsquo;s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.\nFeeblemind # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the creature\u0026rsquo;s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.\nAt the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.\nThe spell can also be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish.\nFind Familiar # 1st-­level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\nYour familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can\u0026rsquo;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\nWhen the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.\nWhile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar\u0026rsquo;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\nAs an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.\nFind Steed # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.\nFind the Path # 6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools- such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes-worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 day\nThis spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn\u0026rsquo;t specific (such as \u0026ldquo;a green dragon\u0026rsquo;s lair\u0026rdquo;), the spell fails.\nFor the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.\nFind Traps # 2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.\nThis spell merely reveals that a trap is present.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.\nFinger of Death # 7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.\nFireball # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\nFire Bolt # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).\nFire Shield # 4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)\nDuration: 10 minutes\nThin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.\nThe flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.\nIn addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.\nFire Storm # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.\nFlame Blade # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (leaf of sumac)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.\nYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.\nThe flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.\nFlame Strike # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.\nFlaming Sphere # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA 5-foot diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere\u0026rsquo;s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.\nWhen you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\nFlesh to Stone # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target\u0026rsquo;s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn\u0026rsquo;t affected.\nA creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\nIf the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.\nFloating Disk # 1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.\nThe disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can\u0026rsquo;t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can\u0026rsquo;t move across a 10-foot deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.\nIf you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can\u0026rsquo;t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\nFly # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.\nFog Cloud # 1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.\nForbiddance # 6th-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)\nDuration: 1 day\nYou create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can\u0026rsquo;t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the plane shift spell.\nIn addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s area can\u0026rsquo;t overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.\nForcecage # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour\nAn immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.\nA prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.\nA prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.\nWhen you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage\u0026rsquo;s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.\nA creature inside the cage can\u0026rsquo;t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can\u0026rsquo;t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.\nThis spell can\u0026rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel magic.\nForesight # 9th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can\u0026rsquo;t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.\nThis spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.\nFreedom of Movement # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target\u0026rsquo;s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target\u0026rsquo;s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target\u0026rsquo;s movement or attacks.\nFreezing Sphere # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling\u0026rsquo;s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn\u0026rsquo;t already shattered, it explodes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.\nSpells (G) # Gaseous Form # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it\u0026rsquo;s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn\u0026rsquo;t affected.\nWhile in this form, the target\u0026rsquo;s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can\u0026rsquo;t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can\u0026rsquo;t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can\u0026rsquo;t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can\u0026rsquo;t attack or cast spells.\nGate # 9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.\nThe portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn\u0026rsquo;t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature\u0026rsquo;s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.\nGeas # 5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 30 days\nYou place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can\u0026rsquo;t understand you is unaffected by the spell.\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.\nGentle Repose # 2nd-level necromancy (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse\u0026rsquo;s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)\nDuration: 10 days\nYou touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can\u0026rsquo;t become undead.\nThe spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don\u0026rsquo;t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.\nGiant Insect # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.\nEach creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.\nA creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.\nThe GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.\nGlibness # 8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 hour\nUntil the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.\nGlobe of Invulnerability # 6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nAn immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\nAny spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can\u0026rsquo;t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.\nGlyph of Warding # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.\nGoodberry # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nUp to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.\nThe berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.\nGrease # 1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)\nDuration: 1 minute\nSlick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.\nWhen the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.\nGreater Invisibility # 4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target\u0026rsquo;s person.\nGreater Restoration # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:\nOne effect that charmed or petrified the target One curse, including the target\u0026rsquo;s attunement to a cursed magic item Any reduction to one of the target\u0026rsquo;s ability scores One effect reducing the target\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum Guards and Wards # 6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.\nGuards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\nCorridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.\nDoors. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.\nStairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.\nOther Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\nPlace dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts. Place magic mouth in two locations. Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts. Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room. Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.\nYou can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.\nGuidance # Divination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.\nGuiding Bolt # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nA flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\nGust of Wind # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a legume seed)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.\nAny creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.\nThe gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\nSpells (H) # Hallow # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 24 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.\nFirst, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can\u0026rsquo;t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.\nSecond, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.\nCourage. Affected creatures can\u0026rsquo;t be frightened while in the area.\nDarkness. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can\u0026rsquo;t illuminate the area.\nDaylight. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can\u0026rsquo;t extinguish the light.\nEnergy Protection. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.\nEnergy Vulnerability. Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.\nEverlasting Rest. Dead bodies interred in the area can\u0026rsquo;t be turned into undead.\nExtradimensional Interference. Affected creatures can\u0026rsquo;t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.\nFear. Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.\nSilence. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.\nTongues. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t share a common language.\nHallucinatory Terrain # 4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren\u0026rsquo;t changed in appearance.\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.\nHarm # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can\u0026rsquo;t reduce the target\u0026rsquo;s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.\nHaste # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nChoose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target\u0026rsquo;s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.\nWhen the spell ends, the target can\u0026rsquo;t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.\nHeal # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nChoose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This spell also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th.\nHealing Word # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.\nHeat Metal # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nChoose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.\nIf a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\nHellish Rebuke # 1st-­level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take in response to being damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.\nHeroes\u0026rsquo; Feast # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a gem-encrusted bowl worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects don\u0026rsquo;t set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve creatures can partake of the feast.\nA creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.\nHeroism # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns. When the spell ends, the target loses any remaining temporary hit points from this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.\nHideous Laughter # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration.

Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light.

If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.\nIf you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.\nIllusory Script # 1st-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 10 days\nYou write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.\nTo you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.\nShould the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.\nA creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\nImprisonment # 9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t age. Divination spells can\u0026rsquo;t locate or perceive the target.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\nBurial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\nChaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can\u0026rsquo;t move or be moved by any means until then.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\nHedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can\u0026rsquo;t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can\u0026rsquo;t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\u0026rsquo;s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.\nIncendiary Cloud # 8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\nWhen the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\nThe cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.\nInflict Wounds # 1st-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nMake a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach.

The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere\u0026rsquo;s area is difficult terrain.\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.\nInstant Summons # 6th-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.\nAt any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item\u0026rsquo;s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.\nIf another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn\u0026rsquo;t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.\nDispel magic or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell\u0026rsquo;s effect.\nInvisibility # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target\u0026rsquo;s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.\nIrresistible Dance # 6th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nChoose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this spell.\nA dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.\nSpells (J) # Jump # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a grasshopper\u0026rsquo;s hind leg)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou touch a creature. The creature\u0026rsquo;s jump distance is tripled until the spell ends.\nSpells (K) # Knock # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nChoose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.\nA target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\nIf you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.\nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.\nSpells (L) # Legend Lore # 5th-level divination\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nName or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn\u0026rsquo;t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.\nThe information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: \u0026ldquo;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips.\u0026rdquo;\nLesser Restoration # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.\nLevitate # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nOne creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.\nThe target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target\u0026rsquo;s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell\u0026rsquo;s range.\nWhen the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.\nLight # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.\nIf you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.\nLightning Bolt # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (100-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\nLocate Animals or Plants # 2nd-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nDescribe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. Concentrating on the voice of nature in your surroundings, you learn the direction and distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles, if any are present.\nLocate Creature # 4th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nDescribe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature\u0026rsquo;s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close-within 30 feet-at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t locate the creature.\nThis spell can\u0026rsquo;t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.\nLocate Object # 2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a forked twig)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nDescribe or name an object that is familiar to you.

If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.\nThe spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close-within 30 feet-at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.\nThis spell can\u0026rsquo;t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.\nLongstrider # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of dirt)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a creature.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.\nYou can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.\nThe hand can\u0026rsquo;t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.\nMagic Circle # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou create a 10-foot radius, 20-foot tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.\nChoose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:\nThe creature can\u0026rsquo;t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder. Targets within the cylinder can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature. When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.\nMagic Jar # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYour body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell\u0026rsquo;s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container\u0026rsquo;s space. You can\u0026rsquo;t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.\nYou can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can\u0026rsquo;t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target\u0026rsquo;s body, and the target\u0026rsquo;s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can\u0026rsquo;t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.\nOnce you possess a creature\u0026rsquo;s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can\u0026rsquo;t use any of its class features.\nMeanwhile, the possessed creature\u0026rsquo;s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can\u0026rsquo;t move or take actions at all.\nWhile possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature\u0026rsquo;s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you\u0026rsquo;re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.\nIf the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.\nWhen the spell ends, the container is destroyed.\nMagic Missile # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.\nMagic Mouth # 2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object\u0026rsquo;s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\nMagic Weapon # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.\nMagnificent Mansion # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.\nBeyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\nYou can create any floor plan you like, but the space can\u0026rsquo;t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can\u0026rsquo;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can\u0026rsquo;t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\nMajor Image # 3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can\u0026rsquo;t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte\u0026rsquo;s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\nMass Cure Wounds # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\nMass Heal # 9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nMass Healing Word # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAs you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.\nMass Suggestion # 6th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake\u0026rsquo;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met before the spell ends, the activity isn\u0026rsquo;t performed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.\nMaze # 8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.\nThe target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).\nWhen the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.\nMeld into Stone # 3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.\nWhile merged with the stone, you can\u0026rsquo;t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can\u0026rsquo;t move.\nMinor physical damage to the stone doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone\u0026rsquo;s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.\nMending # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (two lodestones)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can\u0026rsquo;t restore magic to such an object.\nMessage # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.\nMeteor Swarm # 9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 1 mile\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBlazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.\nThe spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nMind Blank # 8th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 24 hours\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition. The spell even foils wish spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target\u0026rsquo;s mind or to gain information about the target.\nMinor Illusion # Illusion cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else\u0026rsquo;s voice, a lion\u0026rsquo;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\nIf you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can\u0026rsquo;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.\nMirage Arcane # 7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Sight\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 days\nYou make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain\u0026rsquo;s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.\nSimilarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.\nThe illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell\u0026rsquo;s area disappears immediately.\nCreatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain\u0026rsquo;s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion\u0026rsquo;s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.\nMirror Image # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nThree illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack\u0026rsquo;s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\nA duplicate\u0026rsquo;s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can\u0026rsquo;t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.\nMislead # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.\nYou can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.\nMisty Step # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.\nModify Memory # 5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to reshape another creature\u0026rsquo;s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target\u0026rsquo;s memories are modified.\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target\u0026rsquo;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature\u0026rsquo;s memory isn\u0026rsquo;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.\nA modified memory doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature\u0026rsquo;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.\nA remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature\u0026rsquo;s true memory.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target\u0026rsquo;s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature\u0026rsquo;s past (9th level).\nMoonbeam # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.\nWhen a creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can\u0026rsquo;t assume a different form until it leaves the spell\u0026rsquo;s light.\nOn each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.\nMove Earth # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils-clay, loam, and sand)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 2 hours\nChoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area\u0026rsquo;s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can\u0026rsquo;t exceed half the area\u0026rsquo;s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square\u0026rsquo;s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\nAt the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\nBecause the terrain\u0026rsquo;s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can\u0026rsquo;t usually be trapped or injured by the ground\u0026rsquo;s movement.\nThis spell can\u0026rsquo;t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.\nSimilarly, this spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.\nSpells (N) # Nondetection # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 8 hours\nFor the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\nSpells (O) # Spells (P) # Pass without Trace # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can\u0026rsquo;t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.\nPasswall # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)\nDuration: 1 hour\nA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening\u0026rsquo;s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.\nWhen the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.\nPhantasmal Killer # 4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target\u0026rsquo;s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.\nPhantom Steed # 3rd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nA Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature\u0026rsquo;s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.\nFor the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.\nPlanar Ally # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature\u0026rsquo;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM\u0026rsquo;s choice).\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature\u0026rsquo;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature\u0026rsquo;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.\nPlanar Binding # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 24 hours\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell\u0026rsquo;s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.\nA bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.\nPlane Shift # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nAlternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.\nYou can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\nPlant Growth # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.\nIf you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.\nYou can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell\u0026rsquo;s area from being affected.\nIf you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.\nPoison Spray # Conjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).\nPolymorph # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target\u0026rsquo;s (or the target\u0026rsquo;s level, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a challenge rating). The target\u0026rsquo;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the creature\u0026rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u0026rsquo;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nPower Word Kill # 9th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\nPower Word Stun # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\nThe stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.\nPrayer of Healing # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nUp to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\nPrestidigitation # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 1 hour\nThis spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within Range:\nYou create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot. You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\nPrismatic Spray # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nEight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.\nRed. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Orange. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Yellow. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Green. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Blue. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Indigo. On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn\u0026rsquo;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) Special. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8. Prismatic Wall # 9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nThe spell no longer refers to a rod of cancellation, and the text clarifies that dispel magic works only against the violet layer.\nA shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall\u0026rsquo;s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer\u0026rsquo;s properties as described below.\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on it.\nRed. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can\u0026rsquo;t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn\u0026rsquo;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects. Private Sanctum # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\nSound can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it. Sensors created by divination spells can\u0026rsquo;t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter. Creatures in the area can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by divination spells. Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\nProduce Flame # Conjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nA flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.\nYou can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nProgrammed Illusion # 6th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\nProject Image # 7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 miles\nComponents: V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 day\nYou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A\ncreature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\nProtection from Energy # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nFor the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\nProtection from Evil and Good # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration up to 10 minutes\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.\nThe protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.\nProtection from Poison # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.\nFor the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.\nPurify Food and Drink # 1st-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAll nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.\nSpells (Q) # Spells (R) # Raise Dead # 5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.\nThis spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren\u0026rsquo;t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can\u0026rsquo;t return an undead creature to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\nRay of Enfeeblement # 2nd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.\nAt the end of each of the target\u0026rsquo;s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.\nRay of Frost # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nRegenerate # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.\nReincarnate # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.\nIf the target\u0026rsquo;s soul isn\u0026rsquo;t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.\nThe magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature\u0026rsquo;s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.\nTable- Reincarnate Race\nd100 Race 01-04 Dragonborn 05-13 Dwarf, hill 14-21 Dwarf, mountain 22-25 Elf, dark 26-34 Elf, high 35-42 Elf, wood 43-46 Gnome, forest 47-52 Gnome, rock 53-56 Half-elf 57-60 Half-orc 61-68 Halfling, lightfoot 69-76 Halfling, stout 77-96 Human 97-00 Tiefling The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.\nRemove Curse # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAt your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner\u0026rsquo;s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.\nResilient Sphere # 4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.\nNothing-not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects-can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can\u0026rsquo;t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.\nThe sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere\u0026rsquo;s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature\u0026rsquo;s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.\nA disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.\nResistance # Abjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature cloak)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.\nResurrection # 7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn\u0026rsquo;t die of old age, and that isn\u0026rsquo;t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.\nThis spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren\u0026rsquo;t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\nCasting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.\nReverse Gravity # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThis spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.\nIf some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.\nAt the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.\nRevivify # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can\u0026rsquo;t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.\nRope Trick # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.\nThe extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.\nAttacks and spells can\u0026rsquo;t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.\nAnything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.\nSpells (S) # Sacred Flame # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nFlame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nSanctuary # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.\nIf the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.\nScorching Ray # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.\nMake a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.\nScrying # 5th-level divination\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you\u0026rsquo;re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.\nTable- Scrying Save Modifier\nKnowledge Save Modifier Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5 Firsthand (you have met the target) +0 Familiar (you know the target well) -5 Connection Save Modifier Likeness or picture -2 Possession or garment -4 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like -10 On a successful save, the target isn\u0026rsquo;t affected, and you can\u0026rsquo;t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.\nOn a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn\u0026rsquo;t move.\nSecret Chest # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).\nWhile the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.\nAfter 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.\nSee Invisibility # 2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)\nDuration: 1 hour\nFor the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.\nSeeming # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nThis spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can\u0026rsquo;t change a target\u0026rsquo;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature\u0026rsquo;s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature\u0026rsquo;s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.\nSending # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Unlimited\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.\nYou can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t arrive.\nSequester # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nBy means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.\nIf the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t grow older.\nYou can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \u0026ldquo;after 1,000 years\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;when the tarrasque awakens.\u0026rdquo; This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.\nShapechange # 9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature\u0026rsquo;s bonus in place of yours. You can\u0026rsquo;t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can\u0026rsquo;t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u0026rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn\u0026rsquo;t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\u0026rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\nDuring this spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.\nShatter # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a chip of mica)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.\nA nonmagical object that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it\u0026rsquo;s in the spell\u0026rsquo;s area.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\nShield # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nAn invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.\nShield of Faith # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.\nShillelagh # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)\nDuration: 1 minute\nThe wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature\u0026rsquo;s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon\u0026rsquo;s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.\nShocking Grasp # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nLightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions until the start of its next turn.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nSilence # 2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.\nSilent Image # 1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn\u0026rsquo;t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.\nSimulacrum # 7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 12 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature\u0026rsquo;s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.\nThe simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.\nIf the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.\nIf you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.\nSleep # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)\nDuration: 1 minute\nThis spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\nUndead and creatures immune to being charmed aren\u0026rsquo;t affected by this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.\nSleet Storm # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nUntil the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.\nThe ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.\nIf a creature starts its turn in the spell\u0026rsquo;s area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.\nSlow # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of molasses)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.\nAn affected target\u0026rsquo;s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can\u0026rsquo;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature\u0026rsquo;s abilities or magic items, it can\u0026rsquo;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\nIf the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t take effect until the creature\u0026rsquo;s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can\u0026rsquo;t, the spell is wasted.\nA creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.\nSpare the Dying # Necromancy cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nSpeak with Animals # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nSpeak with Dead # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense)\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can\u0026rsquo;t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.\nUntil the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t return the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can\u0026rsquo;t learn new information, doesn\u0026rsquo;t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can\u0026rsquo;t speculate about future events.\nSpeak with Plants # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (30-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell\u0026rsquo;s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.\nIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.\nThis spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.\nSpider Climb # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.\nSpike Growth # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nThe ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.\nThe transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can\u0026rsquo;t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.\nSpirit Guardians # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (a holy symbol)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature\u0026rsquo;s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.\nSpiritual Weapon # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.\nThe weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell\u0026rsquo;s effect resemble that weapon.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.\nStinking Cloud # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a 20-foot radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.\nEach creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\nA moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.\nStone Shape # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn\u0026rsquo;t possible.\nStoneskin # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nThis spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\nStorm of Vengeance # 9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Sight\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.\nEach round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces different effects on your turn.\nRound 2. Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.\nRound 3. You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can\u0026rsquo;t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nRound 4. Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.\nRound 5-10. Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.\nSuggestion # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake\u0026rsquo;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.\nThe target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met before the spell expires, the activity isn\u0026rsquo;t performed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.\nSunbeam # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot wide, 60-foot long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\nYou can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.\nFor the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.\nSunburst # 8th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBrilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\nA creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.\nThis spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.\nSymbol # 7th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature\u0026rsquo;s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\nDeath. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nDiscord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\nFear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\nHopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can\u0026rsquo;t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\nInsanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can\u0026rsquo;t take actions, can\u0026rsquo;t understand what other creatures say, can\u0026rsquo;t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.\nPain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\nSleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\nStunning. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.\nSpells (T) # Telekinesis # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.\nCreature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature\u0026rsquo;s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.\nOn subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.\nObject. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.\nIf the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature\u0026rsquo;s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.\nYou can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.\nTelepathic Bond # 5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren\u0026rsquo;t affected by this spell.\nUntil the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can\u0026rsquo;t extend to other planes of existence.\nTeleport # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can\u0026rsquo;t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.\nTable- Teleport Familiarity\nFamiliarity Mishap Similar Area Off Target On Target Permanent circle - - - 01-100 Associated object - - - 01-100 Very familiar 01-05 06-13 14-24 25-100 Seen casually 01-33 34-43 44-53 54-100 Viewed once 01-43 44-53 54-73 74-100 Description 01-43 44-53 54-73 74-100 False destination 01-50 51-100 - - Familiarity. \u0026ldquo;Permanent circle\u0026rdquo; means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \u0026ldquo;Associated object\u0026rdquo; means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard\u0026rsquo;s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich\u0026rsquo;s secret tomb.\n\u0026ldquo;Very familiar\u0026rdquo; is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \u0026ldquo;Seen casually\u0026rdquo; is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren\u0026rsquo;t very familiar. \u0026ldquo;Viewed once\u0026rdquo; is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \u0026ldquo;Description\u0026rdquo; is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else\u0026rsquo;s description, perhaps from a map.\n\u0026ldquo;False destination\u0026rdquo; is a place that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy\u0026rsquo;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\nOn Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u0026rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\u0026rsquo;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\nMishap. The spell\u0026rsquo;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\nTeleportation Circle # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 round\nAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nMany major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.\nYou can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.\nThaumaturgy # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Up to 1 minute\nYou manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within Range:\nYour voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute. You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute. You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute. You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers. You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut. You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action. Thunderwave # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cube)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t pushed.\nIn addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\nTime Stop # 9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.\nThis spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.\nTiny Hut # 3rd-level evocation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self (10-foot radius hemisphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal bead)\nDuration: 8 hours\nA 10-foot radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can\u0026rsquo;t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.\nTongues # 3rd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.\nTransport via Plants # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nThis spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\nTree Stride # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you\u0026rsquo;re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.\nTrue Polymorph # 9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nChoose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn\u0026rsquo;t affected by this spell.\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target\u0026rsquo;s (or its level, if the target doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a challenge rating). The target\u0026rsquo;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the creature\u0026rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u0026rsquo;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature\u0026rsquo;s size is no larger than the object\u0026rsquo;s size and the creature\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature\u0026rsquo;s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object\u0026rsquo;s size is no larger than the creature\u0026rsquo;s size. The creature\u0026rsquo;s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.\nTrue Resurrection # 9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.\nThis spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.\nThe spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature\u0026rsquo;s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.\nTrue Seeing # 6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.\nTrue Strike # Divination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round\nYou extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target\u0026rsquo;s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn\u0026rsquo;t ended.\nSpells (U) # Unseen Servant # 1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can\u0026rsquo;t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.\nSpells (V) # Vampiric Touch # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThe touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\nVicious Mockery # Enchantment cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).\nSpells (W) # Wall of Fire # 4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nOne side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\nWall of Force # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nAn invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature\u0026rsquo;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can\u0026rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\nWall of Ice # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature\u0026rsquo;s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.\nWall of Stone # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small block of granite)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature\u0026rsquo;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can\u0026rsquo;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can\u0026rsquo;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\nWall of Thorns # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.\nWarding Bond # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.\nWater Breathing # 3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)\nDuration: 24 hours\nThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.\nWater Walk # 3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cork)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.\nIf you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.\nWeb # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.\nIf the webs aren\u0026rsquo;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.\nWeird # 9th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to one minute\nDrawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature\u0026rsquo;s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature\u0026rsquo;s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\nWind Walk # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (fire and holy water)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can\u0026rsquo;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can\u0026rsquo;t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.\nWind Wall # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can\u0026rsquo;t pass through it.\nWish # 9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\nYou create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u0026rsquo;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\u0026rsquo;s life drain attack. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u0026rsquo;s successful save, a foe\u0026rsquo;s critical hit, or a friend\u0026rsquo;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u0026rsquo;s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u0026rsquo;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.\nWord of Recall # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 5 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn\u0026rsquo;t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.\nSpells (X) # Spells (Y) # Spells (Z) # Zone of Truth # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can\u0026rsquo;t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.\nAn affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.\nGamemastering # Conditions # Conditions alter a creature\u0026rsquo;s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster\u0026rsquo;s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.\nA condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.\nIf multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition\u0026rsquo;s effects don\u0026rsquo;t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\nBlinded # A blinded creature can\u0026rsquo;t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature\u0026rsquo;s attack rolls have disadvantage. Charmed # A charmed creature can\u0026rsquo;t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. Deafened # A deafened creature can\u0026rsquo;t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. Exhaustion # Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect\u0026rsquo;s description.\nTable- Exhaustion Effects\nLevel Effect 1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 Death If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect\u0026rsquo;s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect\u0026rsquo;s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level by 1.\nFrightened # A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear. Grappled # A grappled creature\u0026rsquo;s speed becomes 0, and it can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from any bonus to its speed. The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition). The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunder-wave spell. Incapacitated # An incapacitated creature can\u0026rsquo;t take actions or reactions. Invisible # An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature\u0026rsquo;s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\nAttack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature\u0026rsquo;s attack rolls have advantage.\nParalyzed # A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can\u0026rsquo;t move or speak. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Petrified # A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can\u0026rsquo;t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. The creature has resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized. Poisoned # A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Prone # A prone creature\u0026rsquo;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage. Restrained # A restrained creature\u0026rsquo;s speed becomes 0, and it can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from any bonus to its speed. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature\u0026rsquo;s attack rolls have disadvantage. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. Stunned # A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can\u0026rsquo;t move, and can speak only falteringly. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Unconscious # An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can\u0026rsquo;t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings The creature drops whatever it\u0026rsquo;s holding and falls prone. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Pantheons # The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world\u0026rsquo;s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.\nThe Celtic Pantheon # It\u0026rsquo;s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\nTable- Celtic Deities\nDeity Alignment Suggested Domains Symbol The Daghdha, god of weather and crops CG Nature, Trickery Bubbling cauldron or shield Arawn, god of life and death NE Life, Death Black star on gray background Belenus, god of sun, light, and warmth NG Light Solar disk and standing stones Brigantia, goddess of rivers and livestock NG Life Footbridge Diancecht, god of medicine and healing LG Life Crossed oak and mistletoe branches Dunatis, god of mountains and peaks N Nature Red sun-capped mountain peak Goibhniu, god of smiths and healing NG Knowledge, Life Giant mallet over sword Lugh, god of arts, travel, and commerce CN Knowledge, Life Pair of long hands Manannan mac Lir, god of oceans and sea creatures LN Nature, Tempest Wave of white water on green Math Mathonwy, god of magic NE Knowledge Staff Morrigan, goddess of battle CE War Two crossed spears Nuada, god of war and warriors N War Silver hand on black background Oghma, god of speech and writing NG Knowledge Unfurled scroll Silvanus, god of nature and forests N Nature Summer oak tree The Greek Pantheon # The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks.

Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.\nTable- Egyptian Deities\nDeity Alignment Suggested Domains Symbol Re-Horakhty, god of the sun, ruler of the gods LG Life, Light Solar disk encircled by serpent Anubis, god of judgment and death LN Death Black jackal Apep, god of evil, fire, and serpents NE Trickery Flaming snake Bast, goddess of cats and vengeance CG War Cat Bes, god of luck and music CN Trickery Image of the misshapen deity Hathor, goddess of love, music, and motherhood NG Life, Light Horned cowʼs head with lunar disk Imhotep, god of crafts and medicine NG Knowledge Step pyramid Isis, goddess of fertility and magic NG Knowledge, Life Ankh and star Nephthys, goddess of death and grief CG Death Horns around a lunar disk Osiris, god of nature and the underworld LG Life, Nature Crook and flail Ptah, god of crafts, knowledge, and secrets LN Knowledge Bull Set, god of darkness and desert storms CE Death, Tempest, Trickery Coiled cobra Sobek, god of water and crocodiles LE Nature, Tempest Crocodile head with horns and plumes Thoth, god of knowledge and wisdom N Knowledge Ibis The Norse Pantheon # Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It\u0026rsquo;s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven\u0026rsquo;t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it\u0026rsquo;s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).\nTable- Norse Deities\nDeity Alignment Suggested Domains Symbol Odin, god of knowledge and war NG Knowledge, War Watching blue eye Aegir, god of the sea and storms NE Tempest Rough ocean waves Balder, god of beauty and poetry NG Life, Light Gem-encrusted silver chalice Forseti, god of justice and law N Light Head of a bearded man Frey, god of fertility and the sun NG Life, Light Ice-blue greatsword Freya, goddess of fertility and love NG Life Falcon Frigga, goddess of birth and fertility N Life, Light Cat Heimdall, god of watchfulness and loyalty LG Light, War Curling musical horn Hel, goddess of the underworld NE Death Woman\u0026rsquo;s face, rotting on one side Hermod, god of luck CN Trickery Winged scroll Loki, god of thieves and trickery CE Trickery Flame Njord, god of sea and wind NG Nature, Tempest Gold coin Odur, god of light and the sun CG Light Solar disk Sif, goddess of war CG War Upraised sword Skadi, god of earth and mountains N Nature Mountain peak Surtur, god of fire giants and war LE War Flaming sword Thor, god of storms and thunder CG Tempest, War Hammer Thrym, god of frost giants and cold CE War White double-bladed axe Tyr, god of courage and strategy LN Knowledge, War Sword Uller, god of hunting and winter CN Nature Longbow Planes # The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the planes of existence. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.\nMany spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\nThe Material Plane # The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.\nThe worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\nBeyond the Material # Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They\u0026rsquo;re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\nPlanar Travel # When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\nSpells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the astral projection spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\nPortals. A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\nTransitive Planes # The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and astral projection allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\nThe Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.\nThe Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\nInner Planes # The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four Elemental Planes - Air, Earth, Fire, and Water - form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning Elemental Chaos.\nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\nOuter Planes # If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.\nWhen discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \u0026ldquo;places\u0026rdquo; at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\nOuter Planes # The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane\u0026rsquo;s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the plane\u0026rsquo;s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\nDemiplanes # Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don\u0026rsquo;t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\nSituational Rules # Traps # Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.\nA trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\nTraps in Play # When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\nTriggering a Trap # Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap\u0026rsquo;s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap # Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap\u0026rsquo;s presence.\nA trap\u0026rsquo;s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap\u0026rsquo;s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character\u0026rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap\u0026rsquo;s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap\u0026rsquo;s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use dispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap\u0026rsquo;s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character\u0026rsquo;s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap\u0026rsquo;s description to determine what happens. No trap\u0026rsquo;s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap\u0026rsquo;s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it\u0026rsquo;s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\nTrap Effects # The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap\u0026rsquo;s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.\nThe attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap\u0026rsquo;s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.\nA trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\nTable- Trap Dangers\nTrap Danger Save DC Attack Bonus Setback 10-11 +3 to +5 Dangerous 12-15 +6 to +8 Deadly 16-20 +9 to +12 Table- Trap Severity\nCharacter Level Setback Dangerous Deadly 1st-4th 1d10 2d10 4d10 5th-10th 2d10 4d10 10d10 11th-16th 4d10 10d10 18d10 17th-20th 10d10 18d10 24d10 Complex Traps # Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.\nWhen a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap\u0026rsquo;s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.\nFor example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap\u0026rsquo;s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\nSample Traps # The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\nCollapsing Roof # Mechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it\u0026rsquo;s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\nFalling Net # Mechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\nFire-Breathing Statue # Magic trap\nThis trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.\nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nWedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\nPits # Mechanical trap\nFour basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit\u0026rsquo;s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.\nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit\u0026rsquo;s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.\nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit\u0026rsquo;s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.\nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit\u0026rsquo;s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock spell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Darts # Mechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8\nbonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don\u0026rsquo;t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Needle # Mechanical trap\nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest\u0026rsquo;s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap\u0026rsquo;s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\nRolling Sphere # Mechanical trap\nWhen 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap\u0026rsquo;s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.\nWith a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate\u0026rsquo;s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.\nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures\u0026rsquo; spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature\u0026rsquo;s space or a creature enters its space while it\u0026rsquo;s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can\u0026rsquo;t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere\u0026rsquo;s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere\u0026rsquo;s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\nSphere of Annihilation # Magic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation that can\u0026rsquo;t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal sphere of annihilation.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the sympathy aspect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this enchantment.\nDiseases # A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren\u0026rsquo;t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\nSample Diseases # The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\nCackle Fever # This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \u0026ldquo;the shrieks.\u0026rdquo;\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can\u0026rsquo;t be removed until the disease is cured.\nAny event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\nSewer Plague # Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague\u0026rsquo;s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature\u0026rsquo;s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\nSight Rot # This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature\u0026rsquo;s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\nMadness # In a typical campaign, characters aren\u0026rsquo;t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.\nGoing Mad # Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.\nMadness Effects # Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.\nA character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.\nA character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.\nA character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.\nTable- Madness Short-Term Effects\nd100 Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes) 01-20 The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed. The effect ends if the character takes any damage. 21-30 The character becomes incapacitated and spends the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping. 31-40 The character becomes frightened and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear. 41-50 The character begins babbling and is incapable of normal speech or spellcasting. 51-60 The character must use his or her action each round to attack the nearest creature. 61-70 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. 71-75 The character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that isn\u0026rsquo;t obviously self- destructive. 76-80 The character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal. 81-90 The character is stunned. 91-100 The character falls unconscious. Table- Madness Long-Term Effects\nd100 Effect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours) 01-10 The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins. 11-20 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. 21-30 The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks. 31-40 The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. 41-45 The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects. 46-55 The character becomes attached to a \u0026ldquo;lucky charm,\u0026rdquo; such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it. 56-65 The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%). 66-75 The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity. 76-85 The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. 86-90 Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute. 91-95 The character loses the ability to speak. 96-100 The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character. Table- Madness Indefinite Flaws\nd100 Flaw (lasts until cured) 01-15 \u0026ldquo;Being drunk keeps me sane.\u0026rdquo; 16-25 \u0026ldquo;I keep whatever I find.\u0026rdquo; 26-30 \u0026ldquo;I try to become more like someone else I know-adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.\u0026rdquo; 31-35 \u0026ldquo;I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.\u0026rdquo; 36-45 \u0026ldquo;Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I\u0026rsquo;ll ignore everything else to pursue it.\u0026rdquo; 46-50 \u0026ldquo;I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.\u0026rdquo; 51-55 \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like the way people judge me all the time.\u0026rdquo; 56-70 \u0026ldquo;I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know.\u0026rdquo; 71-80 \u0026ldquo;I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they\u0026rsquo;re watching me all the time.\u0026rdquo; 81-85 \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend.\u0026rdquo; 86-95 \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.\u0026rdquo; 96-100 \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered that I really like killing people.\u0026rdquo; Curing Madness # A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.\nObjects # When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire\u0026rsquo;s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character\u0026rsquo;s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\nStatistics for Objects # When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\nArmor Class. An object\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\nTable- Object\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class\nSubstance AC Cloth, paper, rope 11 Crystal, glass, ice 13 Wood, bone 15 Stone 17 Iron, steel 19 Mithral 21 Adamantine 23 Hit Points. An object\u0026rsquo;s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\nTable- Object\u0026rsquo;s Hit Points\nSize Fragile Resilient Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4) Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6) Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8) Large (cart, 10-ft-by-10-ft window) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10) Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object\u0026rsquo;s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section\u0026rsquo;s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can\u0026rsquo;t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\nDamage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object\u0026rsquo;s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the object\u0026rsquo;s hit points.\nPoisons # Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.\nPoisons come in the following four types.\nContact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\nIngested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\nInhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one\u0026rsquo;s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.\nInjury. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.\nTable- List of Poisons\nItem Type Price/Dose Assassin\u0026rsquo;s blood Ingested 150 gp Burnt othur fumes Inhaled 500 gp Crawler mucus Contact 200 gp Drow poison Injury 200 gp Essence of ether Inhaled 300 gp Malice Inhaled 250 gp Midnight tears Ingested 1,500 gp Oil of taggit Contact 400 gp Pale tincture Ingested 250 gp Purple worm poison Injury 2,000 gp Serpent venom Injury 200 gp Torpor Ingested 600 gp Truth serum Ingested 150 gp Wyvern poison Injury 1,200 gp Sample Poisons # Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.\nAssassin\u0026rsquo;s Blood (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t poisoned.\nBurnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.\nCrawler Mucus (Contact). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nDrow Poison (Injury). This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.\nEssence of Ether (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.\nMalice (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded.\nMidnight Tears (Ingested). A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nOil of Taggit (Contact). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.\nPale Tincture (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can\u0026rsquo;t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.\nPurple Worm Poison (Injury). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSerpent Venom (Injury). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nTorpor (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.\nTruth Serum (Ingested).

This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nTreasure # Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item\u0026rsquo;s description gives the item\u0026rsquo;s name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.\nMagic Items (A) # Adamantine Armor # Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon\nThis suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you\u0026rsquo;re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.\nAmmunition, +1, +2, or +3 # Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition.

It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.\nAmulet of Proof against Detection and Location # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\nAmulet of the Planes # Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.\nAnimated Shield # Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.\nApparatus of the Crab # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\nArmor Class 20\nHit Points 200\nSpeed 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren\u0026rsquo;t extended)\nDamage Immunities poison, psychic\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus\u0026rsquo;s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus\u0026rsquo;s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.\nTable- Apparatus of the Crab\nLever Up Down 1 Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus\u0026rsquo;s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed. 2 Forward window shutter opens. Forward window shutter closes. 3 Side window shutters open (two per side). Side window shutters close (two per side). 4 Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus. The claws retract. 5 Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

Armor, +1, +2, or +3 # Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3)\nYou have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.\nArmor of Invulnerability # Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nArmor of Resistance # Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.\nTable- Armor of Resistance\nd10 Damage Type 1 Acid 2 Cold 3 Fire 4 Force 5 Lightning 6 Necrotic 7 Poison 8 Psychic 9 Radiant 10 Thunder Armor of Vulnerability # Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.\nCurse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).\nArrow-Catching Shield # Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield\u0026rsquo;s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.\nArrow of Slaying # Weapon (arrow), very rare\nAn arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\nOnce an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.\nOther types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.\nMagic Items (B) # Bag of Beans # Wondrous item, rare\nInside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.\nIf you dump the bag\u0026rsquo;s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nIf you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.\nTable- Bag of Beans\nd100 Effect 01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour. 02-10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM\u0026rsquo;s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds. 11-20 A treant sprouts. There\u0026rsquo;s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks. 21-30 An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. 31-40 A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished). 41-50 1d6+6 shriekers sprout. 51-60 1d4+8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke. 61-70 A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. 71-80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10+20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. 81-90 A nest of 1d4+3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. 91-99 A pyramid with a 60-foot square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord\u0026rsquo;s lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. 100 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant\u0026rsquo;s castle, or a different plane of existence. Bag of Devouring # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.\nThe extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn\u0026rsquo;t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.\nInanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.\nBag of Holding # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.\nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\nPlacing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can\u0026rsquo;t be reopened.\nBag of Tricks # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.\nYou can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag\u0026rsquo;s color.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.\nOnce three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nTable- Gray Bag of Tricks\nd8 Creature 1 Weasel 2 Giant rat 3 Badger 4 Boar 5 Panther 6 Giant badger 7 Dire wolf 8 Giant elk Table- Rust Bag of Tricks\nd8 Creature 1 Rat 2 Owl 3 Mastiff 4 Goat 5 Giant goat 6 Giant boar 7 Lion 8 Brown bear Table- Tan Bag of Tricks\nd8 Creature 1 Jackal 2 Ape 3 Baboon 4 Axe beak 5 Black bear 6 Giant weasel 7 Giant hyena 8 Tiger Bead of Force # Wondrous item, rare\nThis small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4+4 beads of force are found together.\nYou can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere\u0026rsquo;s wall. No attack or other effect can.\nAn enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere\u0026rsquo;s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature\u0026rsquo;s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.\nBelt of Dwarvenkind # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:\nYour Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.

You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish. Belt of Giant Strength # Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt\u0026rsquo;s score, the item has no effect on you.\nSix varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant strength look different, but they have the same effect.\nTable- Belt of Strength\nType Strength Rarity Hill giant 21 Rare Stone/frost giant 23 Very rare Fire giant 25 Very rare Cloud giant 27 Legendary Storm giant 29 Legendary Berserker Axe # Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.\nCurse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nWhenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nBoots of Elvenkind # Wondrous item, uncommon\nWhile you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.\nBoots of Levitation # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use an action to cast the levitate spell on yourself at will.\nBoots of Speed # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots\u0026rsquo; heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.\nWhen the boots\u0026rsquo; property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.\nBoots of Striding and Springing # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn\u0026rsquo;t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can\u0026rsquo;t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.\nBoots of the Winterlands # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:\nYou have resistance to cold damage. You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.

It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.\nYou can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.\nMagic Items (C) # Candle of Invocation # Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity\u0026rsquo;s alignment. The candle\u0026rsquo;s alignment can be detected with the detect evil and good spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.\nTable- Candle of Invocation\nd20 Alignment 1-2 Chaotic evil 3-4 Chaotic neutral 5-7 Chaotic good 8-9 Neutral evil 10-11 Neutral 12-13 Neutral good 14-15 Lawful evil 16-17 Lawful neutral 18-20 Lawful good The candle\u0026rsquo;s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle\u0026rsquo;s total burn time.\nWhile lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle\u0026rsquo;s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.\nCape of the Mountebank # Wondrous item, rare\nThis cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the dimension door spell as an action. This property of the cape can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nWhen you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination.

The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn. Cloak of Displacement # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.\nCloak of Elvenkind # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak\u0026rsquo;s color shifts to camouflage you.

The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.\nYou can use an action to press one of the cube\u0026rsquo;s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube\u0026rsquo;s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier\u0026rsquo;s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.\nIf your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the cube, you can\u0026rsquo;t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.\nTable- Cube of Force Effects\nFace Charges Effect 1 1 Gases, wind, and fog can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. 2 2 Nonliving matter can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. 3 3 Living matter can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. 4 4 Spell effects can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. 5 5 Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. 6 0 The barrier deactivates. The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.\nTable- Cube of Force Charges Lost\nSpell or Item Charges Lost Disintegrate 1d12 Horn of blasting 1d10 Passwall 1d6 Prismatic spray 1d20 Wall of fire 1d4 Cubic Gate # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.\nYou can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.\nThe cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMagic Items (D) # Dagger of Venom # Weapon (dagger), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nYou can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can\u0026rsquo;t be used this way again until the next dawn.\nDancing Sword # Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.\nWhile the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\nAfter the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.\nDecanter of Endless Water # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.\nYou can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:\n\u0026ldquo;Stream\u0026rdquo; produces 1 gallon of water. \u0026ldquo;Fountain\u0026rdquo; produces 5 gallons of water. \u0026ldquo;Geyser\u0026rdquo; produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you. Deck of Illusions # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20-1 cards.\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can\u0026rsquo;t be used again.\nTable- Deck of Illusions\nPlaying Card Illusion Ace of hearts Red dragon King of hearts Knight and four guards Queen of hearts Succubus or incubus Jack of hearts Druid Ten of hearts Cloud giant Nine of hearts Ettin Eight of hearts Bugbear Two of hearts Goblin Ace of diamonds Beholder King of diamonds Archmage and mage apprentice Queen of diamonds Night hag Jack of diamonds Assassin Ten of diamonds Fire giant Nine of diamonds Ogre mage Eight of diamonds Gnoll Two of diamonds Kobold Ace of spades Lich King of spades Priest and two acolytes Queen of spades Medusa Jack of spades Veteran Ten of spades Frost giant Nine of spades Troll Eight of spades Hobgoblin Two of spades Goblin Ace of clubs Iron golem King of clubs Bandit captain and three bandits Queen of clubs Erinyes Jack of clubs Berserker Ten of clubs Hill giant Nine of clubs Ogre Eight of clubs Orc Two of clubs Kobold Jokers (2) You (the deck\u0026rsquo;s owner) Deck of Many Things # Wondrous item, legendary\nUsually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\nTable- Deck of Many Things\nPlaying Card Card Ace of diamonds Vizier* King of diamonds Sun Queen of diamonds Moon Jack of diamonds Star Two of diamonds Comet* Ace of hearts The Fates* King of hearts Throne Queen of hearts Key Jack of hearts Knight Two of hearts Gem* Ace of clubs Talons* King of clubs The Void Queen of clubs Flames Jack of clubs Skull Two of clubs Idiot* Ace of spades Donjon* King of spades Ruin Queen of spades Euryale Jack of spades Rogue Two of spades Balance* Joker (with TM) Fool* Joker (without TM) Jester * Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\nBalance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\nComet. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\nDonjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can\u0026rsquo;t be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\nEuryale. The card\u0026rsquo;s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\nThe Fates. Reality\u0026rsquo;s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card\u0026rsquo;s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\nFlames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\nFool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\nGem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\nIdiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4+1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\nJester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\nKey. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\nKnight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\nMoon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\nRogue. A nonplayer character of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn\u0026rsquo;t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC\u0026rsquo;s hostility toward you.\nRuin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\nSkull. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can\u0026rsquo;t be restored to life.\nAvatar of Death # Medium undead, neutral evil\nArmor Class 20\nHit Points half the hit point maximum of its summoner\nSpeed 60 ft., fly 60 ft.

The avatar can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.\nTurning Immunity. The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.\nActions # Reaping Scythe. The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.\nStar. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can\u0026rsquo;t exceed 24.\nSun. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\nTalons. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren\u0026rsquo;t destroyed but do vanish.\nThrone. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nVizier. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nThe Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can\u0026rsquo;t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\nDefender # Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword\u0026rsquo;s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\nDemon Armor # Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor\u0026rsquo;s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.\nCurse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can\u0026rsquo;t doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.\nDimensional Shackles # Wondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don\u0026rsquo;t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.\nYou and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.\nDragon Scale Mail # Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)\nDragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).\nAdditionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nTable- Dragon Scale Mail\nDragon Resistance Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold Dragon Slayer # Weapon (any sword), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nWhen you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon\u0026rsquo;s type. For the purpose of this weapon, \u0026ldquo;dragon\u0026rdquo; refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.\nDust of Disappearance # Wondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.\nDust of Dryness # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis small packet contains 1d6+4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet\u0026rsquo;s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet\u0026rsquo;s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nDust of Sneezing and Choking # Wondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.\nDwarven Plate # Armor (plate), very rare\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.\nDwarven Thrower # Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.\nMagic Items (E) # Efficient Quiver # Wondrous item, uncommon\nEach of the quiver\u0026rsquo;s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.\nYou can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\nEfreeti Bottle # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\nThe first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nTable- Efreeti Bottle\nd100 Effect 01-10 The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. 11-90 The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can\u0026rsquo;t be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. 91-100 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. Elemental Gem # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell, and the gem\u0026rsquo;s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nTable- Elemental Gem\nGem Summoned Elemental Blue sapphire Air elemental Yellow diamond Earth elemental Red corundum Fire elemental Emerald Water elemental Elven Chain # Armor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\nEversmoking Bottle # Wondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud\u0026rsquo;s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\nEyes of Charming # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.\nEyes of Minute Seeing # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.\nEyes of the Eagle # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.\nMagic Items (F) # Feather Token # Wondrous item, rare\nThis tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.\nTable- Feather Token\nd100 Feather Token 01-20 Anchor 21-35 Bird 36-50 Fan 51-65 Swan boat 66-90 Tree 91-100 Whip Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can\u0026rsquo;t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\nBird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can\u0026rsquo;t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\nFan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.\nSwan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot long, 20-foot wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.\nTree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\nWhip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6+5 force damage.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.\nFigurine of Wondrous Power # Wondrous item, rarity by figurine\nA figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u0026rsquo;t become a creature.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u0026rsquo;s description.\nBronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 5 days have passed.\nEbony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 2 days have passed.\nGiant Fly # Large beast, unaligned\nArmor Class 11\nHit Points 19 (3d10+3)\nSpeed 30 ft., fly 60 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 14 (+2) 13 (+1) 13 (+1) 2 (-4) 10 (+0) 3 (-4) Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10\nLanguages -\nGolden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nIvory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\nThe goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 30 days have passed. The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\u0026rsquo;t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat\u0026rsquo;s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 15 days have passed. Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nObsidian Steed (Very Rare).

The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.\nFolding Boat # Wondrous item, rare\nThis object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.\nOne command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep.

While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\nThe first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn\u0026rsquo;t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem. The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word. When all of the gem\u0026rsquo;s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.\nGem of Seeing # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis gem has 3 charges.

The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.\nGloves of Missile Snaring # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you\u0026rsquo;re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10+your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.\nGloves of Swimming and Climbing # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don\u0026rsquo;t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.\nGoggles of Night # Wondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.\nThe hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet.

The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can\u0026rsquo;t be reopened.\nHat of Disguise # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will.

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm. As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage. As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon. Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.\nHelm of Comprehending Languages # Wondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the comprehend languages spell from it at will.\nHelm of Telepathy # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it.

It can reply-using a bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.\nWhile focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature.

Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.\nEach use of the horn\u0026rsquo;s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\nHorn of Valhalla # Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)\nYou can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nFour types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn\u0026rsquo;s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn\u0026rsquo;s type or determines it randomly.\nTable- Horn of Valhalla\nd100 Horn Type Berserkers Summoned Requirement 01-40 Silver 2d4+2 None 41-75 Brass 3d4+3 Proficiency with all simple weapons 76-90 Bronze 4d4+4 Proficiency with all medium armor 91-00 Iron 5d4+5 Proficiency with all martial weapons If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\nHorseshoes of Speed # Wondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature\u0026rsquo;s walking speed by 30 feet.\nMagic Items (I) # Immovable Rod # Rod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn\u0026rsquo;t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\nInstant Fortress # Wondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\nThe tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,\nimmunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\nIoun Stone # Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nAn Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.\nWhen you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.\nA stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can\u0026rsquo;t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare).

You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can\u0026rsquo;t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare). You don\u0026rsquo;t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\nIron Bands of Binding # Wondrous item, rare\nThis rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.\nMake a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.\nA creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.\nOnce the bands are used, they can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nIron Flask # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask\u0026rsquo;s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you\u0026rsquo;re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn\u0026rsquo;t age.\nYou can use an action to remove the flask\u0026rsquo;s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.\nAn identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nTable- Iron Flask\nd100 Contents 1‒50 Empty 51‒54 Demon (type 1) 55‒58 Demon (type 2) 59‒62 Demon (type 3) 63‒64 Demon (type 4) 65 Demon (type 5) 66 Demon (type 6) 67 Deva 68‒69 Devil (greater) 70‒73 Devil (lesser) 74‒75 Djinni 76‒77 Efreeti 78‒83 Elemental (any) 84‒86 Invisible stalker 87‒90 Night hag 91 Planetar 92‒95 Salamander 96 Solar 97‒99 Succubus/incubus 100 Xorn Magic Items (J) # Javelin of Lightning # Weapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon.

If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book\u0026rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nMarvelous Pigments # Wondrous item, very rare\nTypically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons - that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\nMedallion of Thoughts # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMirror of Life Trapping # Wondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror\u0026rsquo;s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror\u0026rsquo;s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror\u0026rsquo;s cells don\u0026rsquo;t age, and they don\u0026rsquo;t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror\u0026rsquo;s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\nMithral Armor # Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon\nMithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nMagic Items (N) # Necklace of Adaptation # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\nNecklace of Fireballs # Wondrous item, rare\nThis necklace has 1d6+3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\nNecklace of Prayer Beads # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)\nThis necklace has 1d4+2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.\nSix types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead\u0026rsquo;s spell is cast, that bead can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nTable- Necklace of Prayer Beads\nd20 Bead of \u0026hellip; Spell 1-6 Blessing Bless 7-12 Curing Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration 13-16 Favor Greater restoration 17-18 Smiting Branding smite 19 Summons Planar ally 20 Wind walking Wind walk Nine Lives Stealer # Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe sword has 1d8+1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\nMagic Items (O) # Oathbow # Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, \u0026ldquo;Swift defeat to my enemies.\u0026rdquo; When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, \u0026ldquo;Swift death to you who have wronged me.\u0026rdquo; The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.\nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.\nOil of Etherealness # Potion, rare\nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it\u0026rsquo;s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\nOil of Sharpness # Potion, very rare\nThis clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\nOil of Slipperiness # Potion, uncommon\nThis sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it\u0026rsquo;s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.\nAlternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\nMagic Items (P) # Pearl of Power # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)\nWhile this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nPeriapt of Health # Wondrous item, uncommon\nYou are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.\nPeriapt of Proof against Poison # Wondrous item, rare\nThis delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage.\nPeriapt of Wound Closure # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.\nPhilter of Love # Potion, uncommon\nThe next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion\u0026rsquo;s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\nPipes of Haunting # Wondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nPipes of the Sewers # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren\u0026rsquo;t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nWhenever a swarm of rats that isn\u0026rsquo;t under another creature\u0026rsquo;s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm\u0026rsquo;s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by the pipes\u0026rsquo; music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes\u0026rsquo; music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can\u0026rsquo;t hear the pipes\u0026rsquo; music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by the pipes\u0026rsquo; music for the next 24 hours.\nPlate Armor of Etherealness # Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile you\u0026rsquo;re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nPortable Hole # Wondrous item, rare\nThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can\u0026rsquo;t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\nYou can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what\u0026rsquo;s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole\u0026rsquo;s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can\u0026rsquo;t be reopened.\nPotion of Animal Friendship # Potion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.\nPotion of Clairvoyance # Potion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the clairvoyance spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.\nPotion of Climbing # Potion, common\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour.

Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.\nPotion of Diminution # Potion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the \u0026ldquo;reduce\u0026rdquo; effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion\u0026rsquo;s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\nPotion of Flying # Potion, very rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion\u0026rsquo;s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.\nPotion of Gaseous Form # Potion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion\u0026rsquo;s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.\nPotion of Giant Strength # Potion, rarity varies\nWhen you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.\nThis potion\u0026rsquo;s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.\nTable- Potion of Giant Strength\nType of Giant Strength Rarity Hill giant 21 Uncommon Frost/stone giant 23 Rare Fire giant 25 Rare Cloud giant 27 Very rare Storm giant 29 Legendary Potion of Growth # Potion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the \u0026ldquo;enlarge\u0026rdquo; effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion\u0026rsquo;s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\nPotion of Healing # Potion, rarity varies\nYou regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion\u0026rsquo;s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion\u0026rsquo;s red liquid glimmers when agitated.\nTable- Potions of Healing\nPotion of \u0026hellip; Rarity HP Regained Healing Common 2d4+2 Greater healing Uncommon 4d4+4 Superior healing Rare 8d4+8 Supreme healing Very rare 10d4+20 Potion of Heroism # Potion, rare\nFor 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.\nPotion of Invisibility # Potion, very rare\nThis potion\u0026rsquo;s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid.

The potion\u0026rsquo;s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.\nPotion of Poison # Potion, uncommon\nThis concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.\nIf you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.\nPotion of Resistance # Potion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.\nTable- Potion of Resistance\nd10 Damage Type 1 Acid 2 Cold 3 Fire 4 Force 5 Lightning 6 Necrotic 7 Poison 8 Psychic 9 Radiant 10 Thunder Potion of Speed # Potion, very rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the haste spell for 1 minute (no concentration required).

The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.\nWhile summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.\nAfter the djinni departs, it can\u0026rsquo;t be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.\nRing of Elemental Command # Ring, legendary (requires attunement)\nThis ring is linked to one of the four Elemental Planes.

The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it.

To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don\u0026rsquo;t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt.

The robe\u0026rsquo;s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil.

Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.\nThe robe has two of each of the following patches:\nDagger Bullseye lantern (filled and lit) Steel mirror 10-foot pole Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled) Sack In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM chooses the patches or determines them randomly.\nTable- Robe of Useful Items\nd100 Patch 01-08 Bag of 100 gp 09-15 Silver coffer (1 foot long, 6 inches wide and deep) worth 500 gp 16-22 Iron door (up to 10 feet wide and 10 feet high, barred on one side of your choice), which you can place in an opening you can reach; it conforms to fit the opening, attaching and hinging itself 23-30 10 gems worth 100 gp each 31-44 Wooden ladder (24 feet long) 45-51 A riding horse with saddle bags 52-59 Pit (a cube 10 feet on a side), which you can place on the ground within 10 feet of you 60-68 4 potions of healing 69-75 Rowboat (12 feet long) 76-83 Spell scroll containing one spell of 1st to 3rd level 84-90 2 mastiffs 91-96 Window (2 feet by 4 feet, up to 2 feet deep), which you can place on a vertical surface you can reach 97-100 Portable ram Rod of Absorption # Rod, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell\u0026rsquo;s effect is canceled, and the spell\u0026rsquo;s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can\u0026rsquo;t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can\u0026rsquo;t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\nRod of Alertness # Rod, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod\u0026rsquo;s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.\nThe rod\u0026rsquo;s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Lordly Might # Rod, legendary (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod\u0026rsquo;s six buttons as a bonus action. A button\u0026rsquo;s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod\u0026rsquo;s flanged head (you choose the type of sword).\nIf you press button 2, the rod\u0026rsquo;s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 3, the rod\u0026rsquo;s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod\u0026rsquo;s tip, and the rod\u0026rsquo;s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Rulership # Rod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Security # Rod, very rare\nWhile holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.\nFor each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don\u0026rsquo;t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).\nWhen the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until ten days have passed.\nRope of Climbing # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.\nIf you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\nRope of Entanglement # Wondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target\u0026rsquo;s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\nMagic Items (S) # Scarab of Protection # Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells. The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended. Scimitar of Speed # Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.\nShield, +1, +2, or +3 # Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)\nWhile holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield\u0026rsquo;s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield\u0026rsquo;s normal bonus to AC.\nShield of Missile Attraction # Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.\nCurse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.\nSlippers of Spider Climbing # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\nSovereign Glue # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6+1 ounces.\nOne ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\nSpell Scroll # Scroll, varies\nA spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class\u0026rsquo;s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell\u0026rsquo;s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.\nIf the spell is on your class\u0026rsquo;s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10+the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell\u0026rsquo;s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll\u0026rsquo;s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\nTable- Spell Scroll\nSpell Level Rarity Save DC Attack Bonus Cantrip Common 13 +5 1st Common 13 +5 2nd Uncommon 13 +5 3rd Uncommon 15 +7 4th Rare 15 +7 5th Rare 17 +9 6th Very rare 17 +9 7th Very rare 18 +10 8th Very rare 18 +10 9th Legendary 19 +11 A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied.

Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn\u0026rsquo;t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.\nIf you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature\u0026rsquo;s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature\u0026rsquo;s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.\nIf the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\nTable- Sphere of Annihilation\nd100 Result 01-50 The sphere is destroyed. 51-85 The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. 86-00 A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.

The staff then shatters and is destroyed.

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.\nMost sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.\nSentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM\u0026rsquo;s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item\u0026rsquo;s control, not its wielder\u0026rsquo;s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.\nCreating Sentient Magic Items # When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item\u0026rsquo;s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.\nAbilities # A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item\u0026rsquo;s abilities or determine them randomly.

In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. Senses # With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.\nTable- Sentient Magic Items: Senses\nd4 Senses 1 Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet. 2 Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet 3 Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet. 4 Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet. Alignment # A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.\nTable- Sentient Magic Items: Alignment\nd100 Alignment 01-15 Lawful good 16-35 Neutral good 36-50 Chaotic good 51-63 Lawful neutral 64-73 Neutral 74-85 Chaotic neutral 86-89 Lawful evil 90-96 Neutral evil 97-100 Chaotic evil Special Purpose # You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder\u0026rsquo;s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.\nTable- Sentient Magic Items: Special Purpose\nd10 Purpose 1 Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.) 2 Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards. 3 Protector: The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids. 4 Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity. 5 Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity. 6 Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily. 7 Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. 8 Lore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy. 9 Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events. 10 Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created. Conflict # A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item\u0026rsquo;s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder\u0026rsquo;s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\nThe item insists on being carried or worn at all times. The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant. The item demands that its wielder pursue the item\u0026rsquo;s goals to the exclusion of all other goals. The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses to comply with the item\u0026rsquo;s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following: Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it. Suppress one or more of its activated properties. Attempt to take control of its wielder. If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12+the item\u0026rsquo;s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item\u0026rsquo;s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can\u0026rsquo;t use this power again until the next dawn.\nArtifacts # Orb of Dragonkind # Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)\nAges past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb\u0026rsquo;s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can\u0026rsquo;t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\nRandom Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n2 minor beneficial properties 1 minor detrimental property 1 major detrimental property Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).\nYou can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\nCall Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again for 1 hour.\nDestroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.\nMonsters # Monster Statistics # Type # A monster\u0026rsquo;s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.\nThe game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\nAberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature\u0026rsquo;s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.\nBeasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\nCelestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\nConstructs are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\nDragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\nElementals are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.\nFey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\nFiends are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\nGiants tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\nHumanoids are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\nMonstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t fit into any other type.\nOozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\nPlants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\nUndead are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\nTags # A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\nAlignment # A monster\u0026rsquo;s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook for descriptions of the different alignments.\nThe alignment specified in a monster\u0026rsquo;s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster\u0026rsquo;s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing stopping you.\nSome creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster\u0026rsquo;s alignment. Some monster\u0026rsquo;s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\nMany creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don\u0026rsquo;t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don\u0026rsquo;t have an alignment.\nArmor Class # A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster\u0026rsquo;s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.\nHit Points # A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook.\nA monster\u0026rsquo;s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).\nA monster\u0026rsquo;s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\nTable- Hit Dice by Size\nMonster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die Tiny d4 2 1/2 Small d6 3 1/2 Medium d8 4 1/2 Large d10 5 1/2 Huge d12 6 1/2 Gargantuan d20 10 1/2 A monster\u0026rsquo;s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8+2 hit points (average 11).\nSpeed # A monster\u0026rsquo;s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook.\nAll creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster\u0026rsquo;s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.\nSome creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.\nBurrow # A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can\u0026rsquo;t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.\nClimb # A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to spend extra movement to climb.\nFly # A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.\nSwim # A monster that has a swimming speed doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to spend extra movement to swim.\nAbility Scores # Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they\u0026rsquo;re used in play, see the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook.\nSaving Throws # The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn\u0026rsquo;t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don\u0026rsquo;t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.\nA saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster\u0026rsquo;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\nTable- Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\nChallenge Proficiency Bonus 0 +2 1/8 +2 1/4 +2 1/2 +2 1 +2 2 +2 3 +2 4 +2 5 +3 6 +3 7 +3 8 +3 9 +4 10 +4 11 +4 12 +4 13 +5 14 +5 15 +5 16 +5 17 +6 18 +6 19 +6 20 +6 21 +7 22 +7 23 +7 24 +7 25 +8 26 +8 27 +8 28 +8 29 +9 30 +9 Skills # The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nA skill bonus is the sum of a monster\u0026rsquo;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.\nArmor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.\nFor example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.\nSee the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities # Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.\nSenses # The Senses entry notes a monster\u0026rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.\nBlindsight # A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.\nCreatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.\nIf a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.\nDarkvision # A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\nTremorsense # A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can\u0026rsquo;t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.\nTruesight # A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.\nLanguages # The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can\u0026rsquo;t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.\nTelepathy # Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can\u0026rsquo;t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\nA telepathic monster doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can\u0026rsquo;t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.\nA creature within the area of an antimagic field or in any other location where magic doesn\u0026rsquo;t function can\u0026rsquo;t send or receive telepathic messages.\nChallenge # A monster\u0026rsquo;s Challenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.\nMonsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.\nSome monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\nExperience Points # The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.\nUnless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.\nTable- Experience Points by Challenge Rating\nChallenge XP 0 0 or 10 1/8 25 1/4 50 1/2 100 1 200 2 450 3 700 4 1,100 5 1,800 6 2,300 7 2,900 8 3,900 14 11,500 15 13,000 16 15,000 17 18,000 18 20,000 19 22,000 20 25,000 21 33,000 22 41,000 23 50,000 24 62,000 25 75,000 Special Traits # Special traits (which appear after a monster\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.\nInnate Spellcasting # A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can\u0026rsquo;t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating.\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the levitate spell, but the spell has a \u0026ldquo;self only\u0026rdquo; restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\nA monster\u0026rsquo;s innate spells can\u0026rsquo;t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster\u0026rsquo;s innate spells don\u0026rsquo;t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\nSpellcasting # A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.\nThe monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\nA monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.\nPsionics # A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any components to cast its spells.\nActions # When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook.\nMelee and Ranged Attacks # The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \u0026ldquo;weapon\u0026rdquo; might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook.\nCreature vs Target. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo; can be a creature or an object.\nHit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \u0026ldquo;Hit\u0026rdquo; notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\nMiss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \u0026ldquo;Miss:\u0026rdquo; notation.\nGrapple Rules for Monsters\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\nA creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster\u0026rsquo;s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10+the monster\u0026rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) modifier.\nMultiattack # A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can\u0026rsquo;t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\nAmmunition # A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\nReactions # If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\nLimited Usage # Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\nX/Day. The notation \u0026ldquo;X/Day\u0026rdquo; means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \u0026ldquo;1/Day\u0026rdquo; means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\nRecharge X-Y. The notation \u0026ldquo;Recharge X-Y\u0026rdquo; means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster\u0026rsquo;s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\nFor example, \u0026ldquo;Recharge 5-6\u0026rdquo; means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster\u0026rsquo;s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest. This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\nEquipment # A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.\nYou can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster\u0026rsquo;s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.\nIf a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\nLegendary Creatures # A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can\u0026rsquo;t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.\nIf a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t gain that form\u0026rsquo;s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\nLegendary Actions # A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature\u0026rsquo;s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can\u0026rsquo;t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can\u0026rsquo;t use them until after its first turn in the combat.\nA Legendary Creature\u0026rsquo;s Lair # A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\nLair Actions # If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can\u0026rsquo;t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can\u0026rsquo;t use one until after its first turn in the combat.\nRegional Effects # The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\nMonsters (A) # Aboleth # Large aberration, lawful evil\nArmor Class 17 (natural armor)\nHit Points 135 (18d10+36)\nSpeed 10 ft., swim 40 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 21 (+5) 9 (-1) 15 (+2) 18 (+4) 15 (+2) 18 (+4) Saving Throws Con +6, Int +8, Wis +6\nSkills History +12, Perception +10\nSenses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 20\nLanguages Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.\nChallenge 10 (5,900 XP)\nAmphibious. The aboleth can breathe air and water.\nMucous Cloud. While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.\nProbing Telepathy. If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature\u0026rsquo;s greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.\nActions # Multiattack. The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.\nTentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6+5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature\u0026rsquo;s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can\u0026rsquo;t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.\nTail. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage.\nEnslave (3/Day). The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target.

Hit: 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target\u0026rsquo;s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.

If a creature\u0026rsquo;s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker\u0026rsquo;s moan for the next 24 hours\nPhantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn\u0026rsquo;t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can\u0026rsquo;t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker\u0026rsquo;s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.\nCockatrice # Small monstrosity, unaligned\nArmor Class 11\nHit Points 27 (6d6+6)\nSpeed 20 ft., fly 40 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 6 (-2) 12 (+1) 12 (+1) 2 (-4) 13 (+1) 5 (-3) Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\nLanguages -\nChallenge 1/2 (100 XP)\nActions # Bite.

If this effect reduces the target\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag\u0026rsquo;s soul bag.

On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature\u0026rsquo;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag\u0026rsquo;s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag\u0026rsquo;s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.\n\u0026lsquo;Non-Player Characters\u0026rsquo; # This section contains statistics for various humanoid non-player characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.\nCustomizing NPCs # There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.\nRacial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn\u0026rsquo;t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook.\nSpell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC\u0026rsquo;s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn\u0026rsquo;t alter an NPC\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC\u0026rsquo;s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\nAcolyte # Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) Skills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguages any one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 1/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.

Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.\nPirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation\u0026rsquo;s vessels.\nBandit Captain # Medium humanoid (any race), any non-lawful alignment\nArmor Class 15 (studded leather)\nHit Points 65 (10d8 + 20)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 15 (+2) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) 14 (+2) Saving Throws Str +4, Dex +5, Wis +2\nSkills Athletics +4, Deception +4\nSenses passive Perception 10\nLanguages any two languages\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\nActions # Multiattack.

To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.\nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain\u0026rsquo;s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain\u0026rsquo;s colorful reputation.\nBerserker # Medium humanoid (any race), any chaotic alignment\nArmor Class 13 (hide armor)\nHit Points 67 (9d8 + 27)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 17 (+3) 9 (-1) 11 (+0) 9 (-1) Senses passive Perception 10\nLanguages any one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\nReckless.

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\nThese brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\nLawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.\nNeutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.\nChaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\nLawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.\nNeutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don\u0026rsquo;t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.\nChaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.\nLawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.\nNeutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.\nChaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.\nAlignment in the Multiverse # For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.\nThe evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god\u0026rsquo;s influence.)\nAlignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.\nMost creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/references/characterizations/backgrounds/","title":"Backgrounds","section":"References","content":" Backgrounds # Every story has a beginning. Your character\u0026rsquo;s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character\u0026rsquo;s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don\u0026rsquo;t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.\nProficiencies # Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in \u0026ldquo;Using Ability Scores\u0026rdquo;).\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in \u0026ldquo;Equipment\u0026rdquo;).\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.\nLanguages # Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See \u0026ldquo;Languages.\u0026rdquo;\nEquipment # Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.\nSuggested Characteristics # A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.\nCustomizing a Background # You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can\u0026rsquo;t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.\nAcolyte # You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \u0026ldquo;Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\u0026rdquo; or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.\nSkill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion\nLanguages: Two of your choice\nEquipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp\nFeature: Shelter of the Faithful # As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\nSuggested Characteristics # Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\nTable- Suggested Acolyte Characteristics\nd8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person\u0026rsquo;s deeds and example. 2 I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. 3 I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen 4 Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. 5 I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. 6 I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods. 7 I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple\u0026rsquo;s elite.

A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.\nWhen your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character\u0026rsquo;s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.\nEach time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die.

Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).\nWhen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-­‐‑level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4.

Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you\u0026rsquo;re a 5th-level character.\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you\u0026rsquo;ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\nPrerequisites # To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher.

So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.\nHit Points and Hit Dice # You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\nProficiency Bonus # Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class.

You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\nExtra Attack # If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don\u0026rsquo;t add together. You can\u0026rsquo;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter\u0026rsquo;s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock\u0026rsquo;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.\nUnarmored Defense # If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t gain it again from another class.\nSpellcasting # Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\nSpells Known and Prepared. You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\nIf a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class\nSpell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don\u0026rsquo;t have any spells of that higher level.\nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don\u0026rsquo;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.\nPact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\nTable- Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level\nLevel 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 "},{"id":9,"href":"/references/classes/barbarian/","title":"Barbarian","section":"References","content":" Barbarian # Class Features # As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d12 per barbarian level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Strength, Constitution\nSkills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon An explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack and four javelins Table- The Barbarian\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Rages Rage Damage 1st +2 Rage, Unarmored Defense 2 +2 2nd +2 Reckless Attack, Danger Sense 2 +2 3rd +2 Primal Path 3 +2 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 +2 5th +3 Extra Attack, Fast Movement 3 +2 6th +3 Path feature 4 +2 7th +3 Feral Instinct 4 +2 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 +2 9th +4 Brutal Critical (1 die) 4 +3 10th +4 Path feature 4 +3 11th +4 Relentless 4 +3 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 +3 13th +5 Brutal Critical (2 dice) 5 +3 14th +5 Path feature 5 +3 15th +5 Persistent Rage 5 +3 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 5 +4 17th +6 Brutal Critical (3 dice) 6 +4 18th +6 Indomitable Might 6 +4 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 6 +4 20th +6 Primal Champion Unlimited +4 Rage # In battle, you fight with primal ferocity.

Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.\nDanger Sense # At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren\u0026rsquo;t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can\u0026rsquo;t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.\nPrimal Path # At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nFast Movement # Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing heavy armor.\nFeral Instinct # By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.\nBrutal Critical # Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\nRelentless Rage # Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you\u0026rsquo;re raging and don\u0026rsquo;t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.\nPersistent Rage # Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\nIndomitable Might # Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\nPrimal Champion # At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\nBarbarian Paths # Path of the Berserker # For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker\u0026rsquo;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\nFrenzy # Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).\nMindless Rage # Beginning at 6th level, you can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.\nIntimidating Presence # Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.\nRetaliation # Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/references/classes/bard/","title":"Bard","section":"References","content":" Bard # Class Features # As a bard, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per bard level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor\nWeapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords\nTools: Three musical instruments of your choice\nSaving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma\nSkills: Choose any three\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon (a) a diplomat\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an entertainer\u0026rsquo;s pack (a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument Leather armor and a dagger Table- The Bard\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Spells Known Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Spellcasting, Bardic Inspiration (d6) 2 4 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Jack of All Trades, Song of Rest (d6) 2 5 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 Bard College, Expertise 2 6 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 7 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 Bardic Inspiration (d8), Font of Inspiration 3 8 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Countercharm, Bard College Feature 3 9 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 3 10 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 3 11 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 Song of Rest (d8) 3 12 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Bardic Inspiration (d10), Expertise, Magical Secrets 4 14 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 - 4 15 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 15 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 Song of Rest (d10) 4 16 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Magical Secrets, Bard College Feature 4 18 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 Bardic Inspiration (d12) 4 19 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 19 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 Song of Rest (d12) 4 20 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Magical Secrets 4 22 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 22 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Superior Inspiration 4 22 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Spellcasting # You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.\nYour spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.\nCantrips # You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.\nSpell Slots # The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher # You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability # Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nBardic Inspiration # You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nJack of All Trades # Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn\u0026rsquo;t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest # Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nBard College # At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.\nExpertise # At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nFont of Inspiration # Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.\nCountercharm # At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).\nMagical Secrets # By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.\nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.\nYou learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.\nSuperior Inspiration # At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.\nBard Colleges # College of Lore # Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\nThe college\u0026rsquo;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.\nBonus Proficiencies # When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\nCutting Words # Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature\u0026rsquo;s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can\u0026rsquo;t hear you or if it\u0026rsquo;s immune to being charmed.\nAdditional Magical Secrets # At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of bard spells you know.\nPeerless Skill # Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/references/classes/cleric/","title":"Cleric","section":"References","content":" Cleric # Class Features # As a cleric, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per cleric level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma\nSkills: Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient) (a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient) (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon (a) a priest\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack A shield and a holy symbol Table- The Cleric\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Spellcasting, Divine Domain 3 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Channel Divinity (1/rest), Divine Domain Feature 3 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 - 3 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 Destroy Undead (CR 1/2) 4 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Channel Divinity (2/rest), Divine Domain Feature 4 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 4 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement, Destroy Undead (CR 1), Divine Domain Feature 4 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 - 4 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Divine Intervention 5 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 Destroy Undead (CR 2) 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Destroy Undead (CR 3) 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 Destroy Undead (CR 4), Divine Domain Feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Channel Divinity (3/rest) 5 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Divine Intervention improvement 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Spellcasting # As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.\nCantrips # At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.\nDivine Domain # Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.\nDomain Spells # Each domain has a list of spells - its domain spells - that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.\nChannel Divinity # At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead # As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u0026rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nDestroy Undead # Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.\nTable- Destroy Undead\nCleric Level Destroys Undead of CR \u0026hellip; 5th 1/2 or lower 8th 1 or lower 11th 2 or lower 14th 3 or lower 17th 4 or lower Divine Intervention # Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.\nImploring your deity\u0026rsquo;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.\nIf your deity intervenes, you can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.\nCleric Domains # Life Domain # The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy-one of the fundamental forces of the universe-that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).\nTable- Life Domain Spells\nCleric Level Spells 1st bless, cure wounds 3rd lesser restoration, spiritual weapon 5th beacon of hope, revivify 7th death ward, guardian of faith 9th mass cure wounds, raise dead Bonus Proficiency # When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.\nDisciple of Life # Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level.\nChannel Divinity: Preserve Life # Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature on an undead or a construct.\nBlessed Healer # Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level.\nDivine Strike # At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\nSupreme Healing # Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/references/classes/druid/","title":"Druid","section":"References","content":" Druid # Class Features # As a druid, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per druid level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)\nWeapons: Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears\nTools: Herbalism kit\nSaving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom\nSkills: Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon Leather armor, an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack, and a druidic focus Table- The Druid\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Druidic, Spellcasting 2 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Wild Shape, Druid Circle 2 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 - 2 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Wild Shape Improvement, Ability Score Improvement 3 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 - 3 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Druid Circle feature 3 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 3 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Wild Shape Improvement, Ability Score Improvement 3 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 - 3 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Druid Circle feature 4 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Druid Circle feature 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Timeless Body, Beast Spells 4 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Archdruid 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Druidic # You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells # The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.\nWild Shape # Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a flying or swimming speed.\nTable- Beast Shapes\nLevel Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature\u0026rsquo;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can\u0026rsquo;t use them. When you transform, you assume the beast\u0026rsquo;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious. You can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn\u0026rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you\u0026rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you\u0026rsquo;ve already cast. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can\u0026rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u0026rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn\u0026rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\u0026rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle # At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nTimeless Body # Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.\nBeast Spells # Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren\u0026rsquo;t able to provide material components.\nArchdruid # At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren\u0026rsquo;t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\nDruid Circles # Circle of the Land # The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle\u0026rsquo;s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle\u0026rsquo;s mysterious rites.\nBonus Cantrip # When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.\nNatural Recovery # Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.\nCircle Spells # Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells.\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\nTable- Arctic Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd hold person, spike growth 5th sleet storm, slow 7th freedom of movement, ice storm 9th commune with nature, cone of cold Table- Coast Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd mirror image, misty step 5th water breathing, water walk 7th control water, freedom of movement 9th conjure elemental, scrying Table- Desert Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd blur, silence 5th create food and water, protection from energy 7th blight, hallucinatory terrain 9th insect plague, wall of stone Table- Forest Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd barkskin, spider climb 5th call lightning, plant growth 7th divination, freedom of movement 9th commune with nature, tree stride Table- Grassland Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd invisibility, pass without trace 5th daylight, haste 7th divination, freedom of movement 9th dream, insect plague Table- Mountain Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd spider climb, spike growth 5th lightning bolt, meld into stone 7th stone shape, stoneskin 9th passwall, wall of stone Table- Swamp Circle Spells\nDruid Level Circle Spells 3rd acid arrow, darkness 5th water walk, stinking cloud 7th freedom of movement, locate creature 9th insect plague, scrying Land\u0026rsquo;s Stride # Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.\nNature\u0026rsquo;s Ward # When you reach 10th level, you can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.\nNature\u0026rsquo;s Sanctuary # When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.\nSacred Plants and Wood\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\nDruids and the Gods\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/references/classes/fighter/","title":"Fighter","section":"References","content":" Fighter # Class Features # As a fighter, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: All armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Strength, Constitution\nSkills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal, Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) chain mail or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes (a) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack Table- The Fighter\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features 1st +2 Fighting Style, Second Wind 2nd +2 Action Surge (one use) 3rd +2 Martial Archetype 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3 Extra Attack 6th +3 Ability Score Improvement 7th +3 Martial Archetype Feature 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 9th +4 Indomitable (one use) 10th +4 Martial Archetype Feature 11th +4 Extra Attack (2) 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 13th +5 Indomitable (two uses) 14th +5 Ability Score Improvement 15th +5 Martial Archetype Feature 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 17th +6 Action Surge (two uses), Indomitable (three uses) 18th +6 Martial Archetype Feature 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 20th +6 Extra Attack (3) Fighting Style # You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.

You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven\u0026rsquo;t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.\nKi # Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature\u0026rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nFlurry of Blows # Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\nPatient Defense # You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\nStep of the Wind # You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\nUnarmored Movement # Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\nMonastic Tradition # When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\nDeflect Missiles # Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSlow Fall # Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nStunning Strike # Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent\u0026rsquo;s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.\nKi-Empowered Strikes # Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nEvasion # At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon\u0026rsquo;s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nStillness of Mind # Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.\nPurity of Body # At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.\nTongue of the Sun and Moon # Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.\nDiamond Soul # Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.\nTimeless Body # At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can\u0026rsquo;t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.\nEmpty Body # Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can\u0026rsquo;t take any other creatures with you.\nPerfect Self # At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.\nMonastic Traditions # Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.\nWay of the Open Hand # Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.\nOpen Hand Technique # Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy\u0026rsquo;s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\nIt must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. It can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions until the end of your next turn. Wholeness of Body # At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\nTranquility # Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.\nQuivering Palm # At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone\u0026rsquo;s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.\nLay on Hands # Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\nFighting Style # At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can\u0026rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nDefense # While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nDueling # When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nGreat Weapon Fighting # When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\nProtection # When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.\nSpellcasting # By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.\nPreparing and Casting Spells # The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\nDivine Smite # Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon\u0026rsquo;s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.\nDivine Health # By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\nSacred Oath # When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\nOath Spells # Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\nChannel Divinity # Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nAura of Protection # Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nAura of Courage # Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can\u0026rsquo;t be frightened while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nImproved Divine Smite # By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.\nCleansing Touch # Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nSacred Oaths # Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin\u0026rsquo;s training. Some characters with this class don\u0026rsquo;t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin\u0026rsquo;s heart.\nOath of Devotion # The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods\u0026rsquo; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion # Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\nHonesty. Don\u0026rsquo;t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\nCourage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.\nCompassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.\nHonor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.\nDuty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\nOath Spells # You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\nTable- Oath of Devotion Spells\nLevel Paladin Spells 3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary 5th lesser restoration, zone of truth 9th beacon of hope, dispel magic 13th freedom of movement, guardian of faith 17th commune, flame strike Channel Divinity # When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\nSacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\nTurn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u0026rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAura of Devotion # Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nPurity of Spirit # Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\nHoly Nimbus # At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.\nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.\nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.\nBreaking Your Oath\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/references/classes/ranger/","title":"Ranger","section":"References","content":" Ranger # Class Features # As a ranger, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d10 per ranger level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Strength, Dexterity\nSkills: Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons (a) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows Table- The Ranger\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Spells Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 1st +2 Favored Enemy, Natural Explorer - - - - - - 2nd +2 Fighting Style, Spellcasting 2 2 - - - - 3rd +2 Ranger Archetype, Primeval Awareness 3 3 - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 3 - - - - 5th +3 Extra Attack 4 4 2 - - - 6th +3 Favored Enemy and Natural Explorer improvements 4 4 2 - - - 7th +3 Ranger Archetype feature 5 4 3 - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement, Land\u0026rsquo;s Stride 5 4 3 - - - 9th +4 - 6 4 3 2 - - 10th +4 Natural Explorer improvement, Hide in Plain Sight 6 4 3 2 - - 11th +4 Ranger Archetype feature 7 4 3 3 - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 7 4 3 3 - - 13th +5 - 8 4 3 3 1 - 14th +5 Favored Enemy improvement, Vanish 8 4 3 3 1 - 15th +5 Ranger Archetype feature 9 4 3 3 2 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 9 4 3 3 2 - 17th +6 - 10 4 3 3 3 1 18th +6 Feral Senses 10 4 3 3 3 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 11 4 3 3 3 2 20th +6 Foe Slayer 11 4 3 3 3 2 Favored Enemy # Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.\nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.

Your group can\u0026rsquo;t become lost except by magical means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

See the general rules for spellcasting and the ranger spell list.\nSpell Slots # The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher # You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability # Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRanger Archetype # At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.\nPrimeval Awareness # Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn\u0026rsquo;t reveal the creatures\u0026rsquo; location or number.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack # Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLand\u0026rsquo;s Stride # Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.\nVanish # Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can\u0026rsquo;t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.\nFeral Senses # At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can\u0026rsquo;t see. When you attack a creature you can\u0026rsquo;t see, your inability to see it doesn\u0026rsquo;t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn\u0026rsquo;t hidden from you and you aren\u0026rsquo;t blinded or deafened.\nFoe Slayer # At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.\nRanger Archetypes # The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.\nHunter # Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter\u0026rsquo;s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.\nHunter\u0026rsquo;s Prey # At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nColossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it\u0026rsquo;s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.\nGiant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.\nHorde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.\nDefensive Tactics # At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEscape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.\nMultiattack Defense. When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.\nSteel Will. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\nMultiattack # At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nVolley. You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon\u0026rsquo;s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.\nWhirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.\nSuperior Hunter\u0026rsquo;s Defense # At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEvasion. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon\u0026rsquo;s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nStand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\nUncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage against you.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/references/classes/rogue/","title":"Rogue","section":"References","content":" Rogue # Class Features # As a rogue, you have the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor\nWeapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords\nTools: Thieves\u0026rsquo; tools\nSaving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence\nSkills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword (a) a burglar\u0026rsquo;s pack, (b) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack, or (c) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves\u0026rsquo; tools Table- The Rogue\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Sneak Attack Features 1st +2 1d6 Expertise, Sneak Attack, Thieves\u0026rsquo; Cant 2nd +2 1d6 Cunning Action 3rd +2 2d6 Roguish Archetype 4th +2 2d6 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3 3d6 Uncanny Dodge 6th +3 3d6 Expertise 7th +3 4d6 Evasion 8th +3 4d6 Ability Score Improvement 9th +4 5d6 Roguish Archetype feature 10th +4 5d6 Ability Score Improvement 11th +4 6d6 Reliable Talent 12th +4 6d6 Ability Score Improvement 13th +5 7d6 Roguish Archetype Feature 14th +5 7d6 Blindsense 15th +5 8d6 Slippery Mind 16th +5 8d6 Ability Score Improvement 17th +6 9d6 Roguish Archetype Feature 18th +6 9d6 Elusive 19th +6 10d6 Ability Score Improvement 20th +6 10d6 Stroke of Luck Expertise # At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools.

It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves\u0026rsquo; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.\nCunning Action # Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\nRoguish Archetype # At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nUncanny Dodge # Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage against you.\nEvasion # Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon\u0026rsquo;s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nReliable Talent # By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\nBlindsense # Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.\nSlippery Mind # By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.\nElusive # Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated.\nStroke of Luck # At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nRoguish Archetypes # Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.\nThief # You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn\u0026rsquo;t employ.\nFast Hands # Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves\u0026rsquo; tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\nSecond-Story Work # When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.\nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.\nSupreme Sneak # Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.\nUse Magic Device # By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.\nThief\u0026rsquo;s Reflexes # When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can\u0026rsquo;t use this feature when you are surprised.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/references/classes/sorcerer/","title":"Sorcerer","section":"References","content":" Sorcerer # Class Features # As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d6 per sorcerer level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: None\nWeapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Constitution, Charisma\nSkills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus (a) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack Two daggers Table- The Sorcerer\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Sorcery Points Features Cantrips Known Spells Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 - Spellcasting, Sorcerous Origin 4 2 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 2 Font of Magic 4 3 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 3 Metamagic 4 4 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 4 Ability Score Improvement 5 5 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 5 - 5 6 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 6 Sorcerous Origin Feature 5 7 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 7 - 5 8 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 8 Ability Score Improvement 5 9 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 9 - 5 10 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 10 Metamagic 6 11 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 11 - 6 12 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 12 Ability Score Improvement 6 12 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 13 - 6 13 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 14 Sorcerous Origin Feature 6 13 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 15 - 6 14 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 16 Ability Score Improvement 6 14 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 17 Metamagic 6 15 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 18 Sorcerous Origin Feature 6 15 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 19 Ability Score Improvement 6 15 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 20 Sorcerous Restoration 6 15 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Spellcasting # An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic.

You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.\nSpell Slots # The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher # You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability # Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\nSorcerous Origin # Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\nFont of Magic # At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself.

You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.\nFlexible Casting # You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.\nCreating Spell Slots. You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.\nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.\nTable- Creating Spell Slots\nSpell Slot Level Sorcery Point Cost 1st 2 2nd 3 3rd 5 4th 6 5th 7 Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot\u0026rsquo;s level.\nMetamagic # At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.\nCareful Spell # When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell\u0026rsquo;s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.\nDistant Spell # When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.\nEmpowered Spell # When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.\nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.\nExtended Spell # When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.\nHeightened Spell # When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.\nQuickened Spell # When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.\nSubtle Spell # When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.\nTwinned Spell # When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell\u0026rsquo;s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).\nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell\u0026rsquo;s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren\u0026rsquo;t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSorcerous Restoration # At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\nSorcerous Origins # Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.\nDraconic Bloodline # Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\nDragon Ancestor # At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\nTable- Draconic Ancestry\nDragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\nDraconic Resilience # As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\nElemental Affinity # Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\nDragon Wings # At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\nDraconic Presence # Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/references/classes/warlock/","title":"Warlock","section":"References","content":" Warlock # Class Features # As a warlock, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: Light armor\nWeapons: Simple weapons\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma\nSkills: Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus (a) a scholar\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) a dungeoneer\u0026rsquo;s pack Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers Table- The Warlock\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known Spells Known Spell Slots Slot Level Invocations Known 1st +2 Otherworldly Patron, Pact Magic 2 2 1 1st - 2nd +2 Eldritch Invocations 2 3 2 1st 2 3rd +2 Pact Boon 2 4 2 2nd 2 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 5 2 2nd 2 5th +3 - 3 6 2 3rd 3 6th +3 Otherworldly Patron feature 3 7 2 3rd 3 7th +3 - 3 8 2 4th 4 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 3 9 2 4th 4 9th +4 - 3 10 2 5th 5 10th +4 Otherworldly Patron feature 4 10 2 5th 5 11th +4 Mystic Arcanum (6th level) 4 11 3 5th 5 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 11 3 5th 6 13th +5 Mystic Arcanum (7th level) 4 12 3 5th 6 14th +5 Otherworldly Patron feature 4 12 3 5th 6 15th +5 Mystic Arcanum (8th level) 4 13 3 5th 7 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 13 3 5th 7 17th +6 Mystic Arcanum (9th level) 4 14 4 5th 7 18th +6 - 4 14 4 5th 8 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 15 4 5th 8 20th +6 Eldritch Master 4 15 4 5th 8 Otherworldly Patron # At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description.

You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\nSpell Slots # The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.

Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.\nPact Boon # At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.\nPact of the Chain # You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual.

You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can\u0026rsquo;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\nPact of the Tome # Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class\u0026rsquo;s spell list (the three needn\u0026rsquo;t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don\u0026rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don\u0026rsquo;t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nMystic Arcanum # At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Master # At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nEldritch Invocations # If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\nAgonizing Blast # Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\nArmor of Shadows # You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nAscendant Step # Prerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nBeast Speech # You can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.\nBeguiling Influence # You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\nBewitching Whispers # Prerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot.

Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class\u0026rsquo;s spell list (the two needn\u0026rsquo;t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can\u0026rsquo;t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell\u0026rsquo;s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\nChains of Carceri # Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can cast hold monster at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.\nDevil\u0026rsquo;s Sight # You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.\nDreadful Word # Prerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast confusion once using a warlock spell slot.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn.

You can\u0026rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThief of Five Fates # You can cast bane once using a warlock spell slot. You can\u0026rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThirsting Blade # Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nVisions of Distant Realms # Prerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot.\nVoice of the Chain Master # Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar\u0026rsquo;s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar\u0026rsquo;s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.\nWhispers of the Grave # Prerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot.\nWitch Sight # Prerequisite: 15th level\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.\nOtherworldly Patrons # The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.\nThe Fiend # You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz\u0026rsquo;Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.\nExpanded Spell List # The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\nTable- Fiend Expanded Spells\nSpell Level Spells 1st burning hands, command 2nd blindness/deafness, scorching ray 3rd fireball, stinking cloud 4th fire shield, wall of fire 5th flame strike, hallow Dark One\u0026rsquo;s Blessing # Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).\nDark One\u0026rsquo;s Own Luck # Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll\u0026rsquo;s effects occur.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nFiendish Resilience # Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.\nHurl Through Hell # Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.\nYour Pact Boon\nEach Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron\u0026rsquo;s nature.\nPact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One\u0026rsquo;s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.\nPact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.\nPact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/references/classes/wizard/","title":"Wizard","section":"References","content":" Wizard # Class Features # As a wizard, you gain the following class features.\nHit Points # Hit Dice: 1d6 per wizard level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st\nProficiencies # Armor: None\nWeapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows\nTools: None\nSaving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom\nSkills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion\nEquipment # You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus (a) a scholar\u0026rsquo;s pack or (b) an explorer\u0026rsquo;s pack A spellbook Table- The Wizard\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Spellcasting, Arcane Recovery 3 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 Arcane Tradition 3 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 - 3 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 - 4 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Arcane Tradition Feature 4 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 4 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 - 4 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Arcane Tradition Feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Arcane Tradition Feature 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 - 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Spell Mastery 5 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Signature Spell 5 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Spellcasting # As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.\nCantrips # At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\nSpellbook # At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\nPreparing and Casting Spells # The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u0026rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you\u0026rsquo;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability # Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nRitual Casting # You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus # You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher # Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.\nArcane Recovery # You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example, if you\u0026rsquo;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\nArcane Tradition # When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement # When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u0026rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSpell Mastery # At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.\nSignature Spells # When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don\u0026rsquo;t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can\u0026rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nArcane Traditions # The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.\nSchool of Evocation # You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\nEvocation Savant # Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\nSculpt Spells # Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\nPotent Cantrip # Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip\u0026rsquo;s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\nEmpowered Evocation # Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\nOverchannel # Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.\nYour Spellbook\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard\u0026rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\nReplacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\n*If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\nThe Book\u0026rsquo;s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/references/equipment/armor/","title":"Armor","section":"References","content":" Armor # Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.\nArmor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor\u0026rsquo;s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells.\nArmor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.\nHeavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer\u0026rsquo;s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \u0026ldquo;Str 13\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Str 15\u0026rdquo; in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer\u0026rsquo;s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\nStealth. If the Armor table shows \u0026ldquo;Disadvantage\u0026rdquo; in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nShields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.\nLight Armor # Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nPadded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.\nLeather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.\nStudded Leather. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.\nMedium Armor # Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nHide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.\nChain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer\u0026rsquo;s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.\nScale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.\nBreastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer\u0026rsquo;s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.\nHalf Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer\u0026rsquo;s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.\nHeavy Armor # Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.\nHeavy armor doesn\u0026rsquo;t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn\u0026rsquo;t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\nRing Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it\u0026rsquo;s usually worn only by those who can\u0026rsquo;t afford better armor.\nChain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.\nSplint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.\nPlate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.\nTable- Armor\nArmor Cost Armor Class (AC) Strength Stealth Weight Light Armor Padded 5 gp 11 + Dex modifier - Disadvantage 8 lb.

Getting Into and Out of Armor # The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor\u0026rsquo;s category.\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor\u0026rsquo;s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.\nDoff. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.\nTable- Donning and Doffing Armor\nCategory Don Doff Light Armor 1 minute 1 minute Medium Armor 5 minutes 1 minute Heavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutes Shield 1 action 1 action "},{"id":22,"href":"/references/equipment/coinage/","title":"Coinage","section":"References","content":" Coinage # Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The old piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\u0026rsquo;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer\u0026rsquo;s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\u0026rsquo;s rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.\nTable- Standard Exchange Rates\nCoin CP SP EP GP PP Copper (cp) 1 1/10 1/50 1/100 1/1,000 Silver (sp) 10 1 1/5 1/10 1/100 Electrum (ep) 50 5 1 1/2 1/20 Gold (gp) 100 10 2 1 1/10 Platinum (pp) 1,000 100 20 10 1 "},{"id":23,"href":"/references/equipment/expenses/","title":"Expenses","section":"References","content":" Expenses # When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.\nLifestyle Expenses # Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\nAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character\u0026rsquo;s career.\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\nTable- Lifestyle Expenses\nLifestyle Price/Day Wretched - Squalid 1 sp Poor 2 sp Modest 1 gp Comfortable 2 gp Wealthy 4 gp Aristocratic 10 gp minimum Wretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\nSqualid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.\nPoor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\nModest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don\u0026rsquo;t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\nComfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\nWealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\nAristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\nFood, Drink, and Lodging # The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night\u0026rsquo;s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.\nTable- Food, Drink, and Lodging\nItem Cost Ale ~ Gallon 2 sp ~ Mug 4 cp Banquet (per person) 10 gp Bread, loaf 2 cp Cheese, hunk 1 sp Inn stay (per day) ~ Squalid 7 cp ~ Poor 1 sp ~ Modest 5 sp ~ Comfortable 8 sp ~ Wealthy 2 gp ~ Aristocratic 4 gp Meals (per day) ~ Squalid 3 cp ~ Poor 6 cp ~ Modest 3 sp ~ Comfortable 5 sp ~ Wealthy 8 sp ~ Aristocratic 2 gp Meat, chunk 3 sp Wine ~ Common (pitcher) 2 sp ~ Fine (bottle) 10 gp Self-Sufficiency\nThe expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\nMaintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn\u0026rsquo;t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\nServices # Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\nSkilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.\nTable- Services\nService Pay Pay Coach cab ~ Between towns 3 cp per mile ~ Within a city 1 cp Hireling ~ Skilled 2 gp per day ~ Untrained 2 sp per day Messenger 2 cp per mile Road or gate toll 1 cp Ship\u0026rsquo;s passage 1 sp per mile Spellcasting Services # People who are able to cast spells don\u0026rsquo;t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\nHiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/references/equipment/gear/","title":"Gear","section":"References","content":" Adventuring Gear # This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.\nAcid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.\nAlchemist\u0026rsquo;s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist\u0026rsquo;s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\nAntitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.\nArcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item- designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.\nBall Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to make the save.\nBlock and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.\nBook. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).\nCaltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature\u0026rsquo;s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to make the save.\nCandle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\nCase, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.\nCase, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.\nChain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.\nClimber\u0026rsquo;s Kit. A climber\u0026rsquo;s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber\u0026rsquo;s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can\u0026rsquo;t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can\u0026rsquo;t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.\nComponent Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell\u0026rsquo;s description).\nCrowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar\u0026rsquo;s leverage can be applied.\nDruidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.\nFishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer\u0026rsquo;s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nHoly Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \u0026ldquo;Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\u0026rdquo; lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.\nHoly Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.\nHunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.\nLamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\nLock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.\nMagnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.\nManacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can pick the manacles\u0026rsquo; lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.\nMess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.\nOil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.\nPoison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.\nPotion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.\nPouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.\nRations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.\nRope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.\nScale, Merchant\u0026rsquo;s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.\nSpellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.\nSpyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.\nTent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.\nTinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.\nTorch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.\nEquipment Packs\nThe starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.\nBurglar\u0026rsquo;s Pack (16 gp). Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin.

Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.\nArms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.\nMagic Items. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn\u0026rsquo;t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won\u0026rsquo;t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.\nGems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.\nTrade Goods. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/references/equipment/tools/","title":"Tools","section":"References","content":" Tools # A tool helps you to do something you couldn\u0026rsquo;t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock.

This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.\nGaming Set. This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante).

This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.\nMusical Instrument. Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.\nNavigator\u0026rsquo;s Tools. This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator\u0026rsquo;s tools lets you chart a ship\u0026rsquo;s course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.\nPoisoner\u0026rsquo;s Kit.

Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.\nTable- Cost of Trade Goods\nCost Goods 1 cp 1 lb. of wheat 2 cp 1 lb. of flour or one chicken 5 cp 1 lb. of salt 1 sp 1 lb. of iron or 1 sq. yd. of canvas 5 sp 1 lb. of copper or 1 sq. yd. of cotton cloth 1 gp 1 lb. of ginger or one goat 2 gp 1 lb. of cinnamon or pepper, or one sheep 3 gp 1 lb. of cloves or one pig 5 gp 1 lb. of silver or 1 sq. yd. of linen 10 gp 1 sq. yd. of silk or one cow 15 gp 1 lb. of saffron or one ox 50 gp 1 lb. of gold 500 gp 1 lb. of platinum "},{"id":28,"href":"/references/equipment/transportation/","title":"Transportation","section":"References","content":" Mounts and Vehicles # A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal\u0026rsquo;s speed and base carrying capacity.\nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.\nMounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.\nBarding. Barding is armor designed to protect an animal\u0026rsquo;s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.\nSaddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.\nVehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.\nRowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can\u0026rsquo;t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.

Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.\nThe Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.\nWeapon Proficiency # Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.\nProficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\nWeapon Properties # Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.\nAmmunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \u0026ldquo;Improvised Weapons\u0026rdquo; later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\nFinesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\nHeavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon\u0026rsquo;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.\nLight. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\nLoading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\nRange. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon\u0026rsquo;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon\u0026rsquo;s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can\u0026rsquo;t attack a target beyond the weapon\u0026rsquo;s long range.\nReach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.\nSpecial. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon\u0026rsquo;s description (see \u0026ldquo;Special Weapons\u0026rdquo; later in this section).\nThrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.\nTwo-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\nVersatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\nImprovised Weapons # Sometimes characters don\u0026rsquo;t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\nOften, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nSilvered Weapons # Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.\nSpecial Weapons # Weapons with special rules are described here.\nLance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren\u0026rsquo;t mounted.\nNet. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.\nWhen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\nTable- Weapons\nName Cost Damage Weight Properties Simple Melee Weapons Club 1 sp 1d4 bludgeoning 2 lb.

Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.\nA condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.\nIf multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition\u0026rsquo;s effects don\u0026rsquo;t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\nBlinded # A blinded creature can\u0026rsquo;t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature\u0026rsquo;s attack rolls have disadvantage. Charmed # A charmed creature can\u0026rsquo;t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. Deafened # A deafened creature can\u0026rsquo;t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. Exhaustion # Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect\u0026rsquo;s description.\nTable- Exhaustion Effects\nLevel Effect 1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 Death If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect\u0026rsquo;s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect\u0026rsquo;s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level by 1.\nFrightened # A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear. Grappled # A grappled creature\u0026rsquo;s speed becomes 0, and it can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from any bonus to its speed. The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition). The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunder-wave spell. Incapacitated # An incapacitated creature can\u0026rsquo;t take actions or reactions. Invisible # An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature\u0026rsquo;s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\nAttack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature\u0026rsquo;s attack rolls have advantage.\nParalyzed # A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can\u0026rsquo;t move or speak. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Petrified # A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can\u0026rsquo;t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. The creature has resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized. Poisoned # A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Prone # A prone creature\u0026rsquo;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage. Restrained # A restrained creature\u0026rsquo;s speed becomes 0, and it can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from any bonus to its speed. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature\u0026rsquo;s attack rolls have disadvantage. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. Stunned # A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can\u0026rsquo;t move, and can speak only falteringly. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Unconscious # An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can\u0026rsquo;t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings The creature drops whatever it\u0026rsquo;s holding and falls prone.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren\u0026rsquo;t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\nSample Diseases # The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\nCackle Fever # This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \u0026ldquo;the shrieks.\u0026rdquo;\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can\u0026rsquo;t be removed until the disease is cured.\nAny event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\nSewer Plague # Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague\u0026rsquo;s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature\u0026rsquo;s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\nSight Rot # This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature\u0026rsquo;s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/references/gamemastering/madness/","title":"Madness","section":"References","content":" Madness # In a typical campaign, characters aren\u0026rsquo;t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear.

Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.\nMadness Effects # Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.\nA character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.\nA character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.\nA character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.\nTable- Madness Short-Term Effects\nd100 Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes) 01-20 The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed.

Table- Madness Long-Term Effects\nd100 Effect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours) 01-10 The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins. 11-20 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. 21-30 The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks. 31-40 The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. 41-45 The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects. 46-55 The character becomes attached to a \u0026ldquo;lucky charm,\u0026rdquo; such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it. 56-65 The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%). 66-75 The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity. 76-85 The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. 86-90 Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute. 91-95 The character loses the ability to speak. 96-100 The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.

No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\nStatistics for Objects # When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\nArmor Class. An object\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\nTable- Object\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class\nSubstance AC Cloth, paper, rope 11 Crystal, glass, ice 13 Wood, bone 15 Stone 17 Iron, steel 19 Mithral 21 Adamantine 23 Hit Points. An object\u0026rsquo;s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\nTable- Object\u0026rsquo;s Hit Points\nSize Fragile Resilient Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4) Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6) Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8) Large (cart, 10-ft-by-10-ft window) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10) Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object\u0026rsquo;s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section\u0026rsquo;s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can\u0026rsquo;t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\nDamage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object\u0026rsquo;s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the object\u0026rsquo;s hit points.\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/references/gamemastering/pantheons/","title":"Pantheons","section":"References","content":" Pantheons # The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world\u0026rsquo;s ancient times.

They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\nTable- Celtic Deities\nDeity Alignment Suggested Domains Symbol The Daghdha, god of weather and crops CG Nature, Trickery Bubbling cauldron or shield Arawn, god of life and death NE Life, Death Black star on gray background Belenus, god of sun, light, and warmth NG Light Solar disk and standing stones Brigantia, goddess of rivers and livestock NG Life Footbridge Diancecht, god of medicine and healing LG Life Crossed oak and mistletoe branches Dunatis, god of mountains and peaks N Nature Red sun-capped mountain peak Goibhniu, god of smiths and healing NG Knowledge, Life Giant mallet over sword Lugh, god of arts, travel, and commerce CN Knowledge, Life Pair of long hands Manannan mac Lir, god of oceans and sea creatures LN Nature, Tempest Wave of white water on green Math Mathonwy, god of magic NE Knowledge Staff Morrigan, goddess of battle CE War Two crossed spears Nuada, god of war and warriors N War Silver hand on black background Oghma, god of speech and writing NG Knowledge Unfurled scroll Silvanus, god of nature and forests N Nature Summer oak tree The Greek Pantheon # The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks.

It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.\nMany spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\nThe Material Plane # The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.\nThe worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\nBeyond the Material # Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They\u0026rsquo;re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\nPlanar Travel # When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\nSpells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the astral projection spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\nPortals. A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\nTransitive Planes # The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and astral projection allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\nThe Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.\nThe Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\nInner Planes # The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four Elemental Planes - Air, Earth, Fire, and Water - form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning Elemental Chaos.\nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\nOuter Planes # If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.\nWhen discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \u0026ldquo;places\u0026rdquo; at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\nOuter Planes # The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane\u0026rsquo;s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the plane\u0026rsquo;s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\nDemiplanes # Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don\u0026rsquo;t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/references/gamemastering/poisons/","title":"Poisons","section":"References","content":" Poisons # Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.\nPoisons come in the following four types.\nContact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\nIngested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\nInhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one\u0026rsquo;s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.\nInjury. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off.

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.\nCrawler Mucus (Contact). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nDrow Poison (Injury). This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.\nEssence of Ether (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.\nMalice (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded.\nMidnight Tears (Ingested). A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nOil of Taggit (Contact). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.\nPale Tincture (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can\u0026rsquo;t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.\nPurple Worm Poison (Injury). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSerpent Venom (Injury). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nTorpor (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.\nTruth Serum (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can\u0026rsquo;t knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a zone of truth spell.\nWyvern Poison (Injury).

One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.\nA trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\nTraps in Play # When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\nTriggering a Trap # Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap\u0026rsquo;s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap # Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap\u0026rsquo;s presence.\nA trap\u0026rsquo;s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap\u0026rsquo;s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character\u0026rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap\u0026rsquo;s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap\u0026rsquo;s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use dispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap\u0026rsquo;s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character\u0026rsquo;s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap\u0026rsquo;s description to determine what happens. No trap\u0026rsquo;s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap\u0026rsquo;s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it\u0026rsquo;s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\nTrap Effects # The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap\u0026rsquo;s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.\nThe attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap\u0026rsquo;s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.\nA trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\nTable- Trap Dangers\nTrap Danger Save DC Attack Bonus Setback 10-11 +3 to +5 Dangerous 12-15 +6 to +8 Deadly 16-20 +9 to +12 Table- Trap Severity\nCharacter Level Setback Dangerous Deadly 1st-4th 1d10 2d10 4d10 5th-10th 2d10 4d10 10d10 11th-16th 4d10 10d10 18d10 17th-20th 10d10 18d10 24d10 Complex Traps # Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.\nWhen a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap\u0026rsquo;s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.\nFor example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap\u0026rsquo;s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\nSample Traps # The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\nCollapsing Roof # Mechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it\u0026rsquo;s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\nFalling Net # Mechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves\u0026rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\nFire-Breathing Statue # Magic trap\nThis trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.\nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nWedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\nPits # Mechanical trap\nFour basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit\u0026rsquo;s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.\nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit\u0026rsquo;s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.\nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit\u0026rsquo;s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.\nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit\u0026rsquo;s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock spell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Darts # Mechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8\nbonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don\u0026rsquo;t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Needle # Mechanical trap\nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest\u0026rsquo;s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap\u0026rsquo;s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u0026rsquo; tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\nRolling Sphere # Mechanical trap\nWhen 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap\u0026rsquo;s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.\nWith a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate\u0026rsquo;s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.\nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures\u0026rsquo; spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature\u0026rsquo;s space or a creature enters its space while it\u0026rsquo;s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can\u0026rsquo;t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere\u0026rsquo;s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere\u0026rsquo;s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\nSphere of Annihilation # Magic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation that can\u0026rsquo;t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal sphere of annihilation.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the sympathy aspect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this enchantment.\n"},{"id":38,"href":"/references/gameplay/abilities/","title":"Abilities","section":"References","content":" ABILITIES # Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature\u0026rsquo;s physical and mental characteristics:\nStrength, measuring physical power Dexterity, measuring agility Constitution, measuring endurance Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory Wisdom, measuring perception and insight Charisma, measuring force of personality Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature\u0026rsquo;s assets as well as weaknesses.\nThe three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book\u0026rsquo;s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\nAbility Scores and Modifiers # Each of a creature\u0026rsquo;s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature\u0026rsquo;s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\nTable- Ability Scores and Modifiers\nScore Modifier 1 -5 2-3 -4 4-5 -3 6-7 -2 8-9 -1 10-11 +0 12-13 +1 14-15 +2 16-17 +3 18-19 +4 20-21 +5 22-23 +6 24-25 +7 26-27 +8 28-29 +9 30 +10 To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\nAdvantage and Disadvantage # Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don\u0026rsquo;t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling\u0026rsquo;s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The\nGM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\nProficiency Bonus # Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\nYour proficiency bonus can\u0026rsquo;t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue\u0026rsquo;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don\u0026rsquo;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\nIn general, you don\u0026rsquo;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\nAbility Checks # An ability check tests a character\u0026rsquo;s or monster\u0026rsquo;s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.\nThe more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\nTable- Difficulty Classes\nTask Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\nContests # Sometimes one character\u0026rsquo;s or monster\u0026rsquo;s efforts are directly opposed to another\u0026rsquo;s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal- for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\nSkills # Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual\u0026rsquo;s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character\u0026rsquo;s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster\u0026rsquo;s skill proficiencies appear in the monster\u0026rsquo;s stat block.)\nFor example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character\u0026rsquo;s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability\u0026rsquo;s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\nTable- Related Skills\nStrength Dexterity Intelligence Wisdom Charisma Athletics Acrobatics Arcana Animal Handling Deception Sleight of Hand History Insight Intimidation Stealth Investigation Medicine Performance Nature Perception Persuasion Religion Survival Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, \u0026ldquo;Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.\u0026rdquo; At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character\u0026rsquo;s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\nVariant: Skills with Different Abilities # Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\nPassive Checks # A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to determine a character\u0026rsquo;s total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\nThe rules on hiding in the \u0026ldquo;Dexterity\u0026rdquo; section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\nWorking Together # Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who\u0026rsquo;s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves\u0026rsquo; tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can\u0026rsquo;t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\nGroup Checks # When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren\u0026rsquo;t.\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\nGroup checks don\u0026rsquo;t come up very often, and they\u0026rsquo;re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\nUsing Each Ability # Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\nStrength # Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\nStrength Checks # A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\nYou attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off. You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump. You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming. Other Strength Checks. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nForce open a stuck, locked, or barred door Break free of bonds Push through a tunnel that is too small Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it Tip over a statue Keep a boulder from rolling Attack Rolls and Damage # You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\nLifting and Carrying # Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don\u0026rsquo;t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature\u0026rsquo;s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\nVariant: Encumbrance # The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\nDexterity # Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\nDexterity Checks # A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship\u0026rsquo;s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person\u0026rsquo;s pocket.\nStealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nControl a heavily laden cart on a steep descent Steer a chariot around a tight turn Pick a lock Disable a trap Securely tie up a prisoner Wriggle free of bonds Play a stringed instrument Craft a small or detailed object Attack Rolls and Damage # You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\nArmor Class # Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\nInitiative # At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures\u0026rsquo; turns in combat.\nHiding\nThe DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check\u0026rsquo;s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception. When you hide, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren\u0026rsquo;t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature\u0026rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature\u0026rsquo;s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in the \u0026ldquo;Adventuring\u0026rdquo; section.\nConstitution # Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\nConstitution Checks # Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\nThe GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nHold your breath March or labor for hours without rest Go without sleep Survive without food or water Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go Hit Points # Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you\u0026rsquo;re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\nIntelligence # Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\nIntelligence Checks # An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nCommunicate with a creature without using words Estimate the value of a precious item Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard Forge a document Recall lore about a craft or trade Win a game of skill Spellcasting Ability # Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nWisdom # Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\nWisdom Checks # A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone\u0026rsquo;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal\u0026rsquo;s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone\u0026rsquo;s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nGet a gut feeling about what course of action to follow Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead Spellcasting Ability # Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nCharisma # Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\nCharisma Checks # A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone\u0026rsquo;s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\nIntimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nFind the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation Spellcasting Ability # Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nSaving Throws # A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don\u0026rsquo;t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.\nTo make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\nA saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.\nEach class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.\nThe Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster\u0026rsquo;s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.\nThe result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/references/gameplay/adventuring/","title":"Adventuring","section":"References","content":" ADVENTURING # Time # In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers\u0026rsquo; movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours\u0026rsquo; time.\nFor long journeys, a scale of days works best.\nFollowing the road from Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time.\nMovement # Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.\nThe GM can summarize the adventurers\u0026rsquo; movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \u0026ldquo;You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\u0026rdquo; Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: \u0026ldquo;After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\u0026rdquo;\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they\u0026rsquo;re moving over.\nSpeed # Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nTravel Pace # While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix ##).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don\u0026rsquo;t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\nTable- Travel Pace\nDistance Traveled Per \u0026hellip;\nPace Minute Hour Day Effect Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores Normal 300 feet 3 miles 18 miles - Slow 200 feet 2 miles 24 miles Able to use stealth Difficult Terrain # The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult terrain.\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain- moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nSpecial Types of Movement # Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\nClimbing, Swimming, and Crawling # While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\nJumping # Your Strength determines how far you can jump.\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM\u0026rsquo;s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump\u0026rsquo;s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.\nThe Environment # By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.\nFalling # A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\nSuffocating # A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can\u0026rsquo;t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\nVision and Light # The most fundamental tasks of adventuring- noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character\u0026rsquo;s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\nA heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix ##) when trying to see something in that area.\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\nBright light lets most creatures see normally.\nEven gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area.\nCharacters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\nBlindsight # A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\nDarkvision # Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can\u0026rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nTruesight # A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\nFood and Water # Characters who don\u0026rsquo;t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix ##). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can\u0026rsquo;t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\nFood # A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\nWater # A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\nInteracting with Objects # A character\u0026rsquo;s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It\u0026rsquo;s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\nResting # Heroic though they might be, adventurers can\u0026rsquo;t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\nAdventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\nShort Rest # A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character\u0026rsquo;s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character\u0026rsquo;s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character\u0026rsquo;s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.\nLong Rest # A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character\u0026rsquo;s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.\nA character can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\nBetween Adventures # Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\nLifestyle Expenses # Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\nDowntime Activities # Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\nCrafting # You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith\u0026rsquo;s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5 gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\nPracticing a Profession # You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\nIf you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves\u0026rsquo; guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\nRecuperating # You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\nEnd one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points. For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you. Researching # The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone\u0026rsquo;s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\nFor each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\nTraining # You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.\n"},{"id":40,"href":"/references/gameplay/combat/","title":"Combat","section":"References","content":" COMBAT # A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\nCombat Step by Step # Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. Establish positions. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers\u0026rsquo; marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants\u0026rsquo; turns. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops. Surprise # A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn\u0026rsquo;t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re surprised, you can\u0026rsquo;t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can\u0026rsquo;t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren\u0026rsquo;t.\nInitiative # Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\nYour Turn # On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed- sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet.\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the \u0026ldquo;Actions in Combat\u0026rdquo; section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Movement and Position\u0026rdquo; section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can\u0026rsquo;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in \u0026ldquo;Actions in Combat.\u0026rdquo;\nBonus Actions # Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don\u0026rsquo;t have a bonus action to take.\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action\u0026rsquo;s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\nOther Activity on Your Turn # Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\nReactions # Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else\u0026rsquo;s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\nWhen you take a reaction, you can\u0026rsquo;t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature\u0026rsquo;s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\nMovement and Position # In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you\u0026rsquo;re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\nBreaking Up Your Move # You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\nMoving between Attacks # If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.\nUsing Different Speeds # If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you\u0026rsquo;ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can\u0026rsquo;t use the new speed during the current move.\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\nDifficult Terrain # Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\nBeing Prone # Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.\nYou can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend\n15 feet of movement to stand up. You can\u0026rsquo;t stand up if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\nTo move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\nInteracting with Objects Around You\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:\ndraw or sheathe a sword open or close a door withdraw a potion from your backpack pick up a dropped axe take a bauble from a table remove a ring from your finger stuff some food into your mouth plant a banner in the ground fish a few coins from your belt pouch drink all the ale in a flagon throw a lever or a switch pull a torch from a sconce take a book from a shelf you can reach extinguish a small flame don a mask pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head put your ear to a door kick a small stone turn a key in a lock tap the floor with a 10-foot pole hand an item to another character Moving Around Other Creatures # You can move through a nonhostile creature\u0026rsquo;s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature\u0026rsquo;s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature\u0026rsquo;s space is difficult terrain for you.\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can\u0026rsquo;t willingly end your move in its space.\nIf you leave a hostile creature\u0026rsquo;s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.\nFlying Movement # Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.\nCreature Size # Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\nTable- Creature Size\nSize Space Tiny 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft. Small 5 by 5 ft. Medium 5 by 5 ft. Large 10 by 10 ft. Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger Space # A creature\u0026rsquo;s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn\u0026rsquo;t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway, other creatures can\u0026rsquo;t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\nA creature\u0026rsquo;s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there\u0026rsquo;s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there\u0026rsquo;s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space # A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that\u0026rsquo;s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it\u0026rsquo;s in the smaller space.\nActions in Combat # When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\nAttack # The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \u0026ldquo;Making an Attack\u0026rdquo; section for the rules that govern attacks.\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\nCast a Spell # Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\nDash # When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\nDisengage # If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn\u0026rsquo;t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\nDodge # When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.\nHelp # You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally\u0026rsquo;s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\nHide # When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \u0026ldquo;Unseen Attackers and Targets\u0026rdquo; section later in this chapter.\nReady # Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \u0026ldquo;If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I\u0026rsquo;ll pull the lever that opens it,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell\u0026rsquo;s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\nSearch # When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nUse an Object # You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.\nMaking an Attack # Whether you\u0026rsquo;re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.\nChoose a target. Pick a target within your attack\u0026rsquo;s Range: a creature, an object, or a location. Determine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage. If there\u0026rsquo;s ever any question whether something you\u0026rsquo;re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you\u0026rsquo;re making an attack roll, you\u0026rsquo;re making an attack.\nAttack Rolls # When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target\u0026rsquo;s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\nModifiers to the Roll # When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character\u0026rsquo;s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\nAbility Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\nSome spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\nProficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.\nRolling 1 or 20 # Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target\u0026rsquo;s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target\u0026rsquo;s AC.\nUnseen Attackers and Targets # Combatants often try to escape their foes\u0026rsquo; notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\nWhen you attack a target that you can\u0026rsquo;t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you\u0026rsquo;re guessing the target\u0026rsquo;s location or you\u0026rsquo;re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn\u0026rsquo;t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target\u0026rsquo;s location correctly.\nWhen a creature can\u0026rsquo;t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\nRanged Attacks # When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\nRange # You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can\u0026rsquo;t attack a target beyond this range.\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can\u0026rsquo;t attack a target beyond the long range.\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat # Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated.\nMelee Attacks # Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\nContests in Combat\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\nOpportunity Attacks # In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don\u0026rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don\u0026rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe\u0026rsquo;s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting # When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you\u0026rsquo;re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you\u0026rsquo;re holding in the other hand. You don\u0026rsquo;t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\nGrappling # When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target\u0026rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix ##). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\nShoving a Creature # Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target\u0026rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.\nCover # Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren\u0026rsquo;t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\nA target with total cover can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\nDamage and Healing # Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\nHit Points # Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\nA creature\u0026rsquo;s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature\u0026rsquo;s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\nDamage Rolls # Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\nWhen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball or a cleric casts flame strike, the spell\u0026rsquo;s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\nCritical Hits # When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack\u0026rsquo;s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue\u0026rsquo;s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\nDamage Types # Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil\u0026rsquo;s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters\u0026rsquo; bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer\u0026rsquo;s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric\u0026rsquo;s flame strike spell or an angel\u0026rsquo;s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters\u0026rsquo; claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability # Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\nHealing # Unless it results in death, damage isn\u0026rsquo;t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points can\u0026rsquo;t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can\u0026rsquo;t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\nDropping to 0 Hit Points # When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\nInstant Death # Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\nFalling Unconscious # If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix ##). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\nDeath Saving Throws # Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\nStabilizing a Creature # The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn\u0026rsquo;t killed by a failed death saving throw.\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA stable creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn\u0026rsquo;t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\nMonsters and Death # Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\nKnocking a Creature Out # Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\nTemporary Hit Points # Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren\u0026rsquo;t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can\u0026rsquo;t restore temporary hit points, and they can\u0026rsquo;t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn\u0026rsquo;t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you\u0026rsquo;re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they\u0026rsquo;re depleted or you finish a long rest.\nMounted Combat # A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.\nA willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\nMounting and Dismounting # Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can\u0026rsquo;t mount it if you don\u0026rsquo;t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you\u0026rsquo;re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you\u0026rsquo;re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\nControlling a Mount # While you\u0026rsquo;re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you\u0026rsquo;re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.\nUnderwater Combat # When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.\nWhen making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\nA ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon\u0026rsquo;s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.\n"},{"id":41,"href":"/references/monsters-alt/creatures-a-c/","title":"Creatures a C","section":"References","content":" Creatures (A-C) # Ape # Medium beast, unaligned\nArmor Class 12\nHit Points 19 (3d8+6)\nSpeed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 6 (-2) 12 (+1) 7 (-2) Skills Athletics +5, Perception +3\nSenses passive Perception 13\nLanguages -\nChallenge 1/2 (100 XP)\nActions # Multiattack.

If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.\nPincer. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn\u0026rsquo;t have two other creatures grappled.\nTentacles. One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nCloaker # Large aberration, chaotic neutral\nArmor Class 14 (natural armor)\nHit Points 78 (12d10+12)\nSpeed 10 ft., fly 40 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 17 (+3) 15 (+2) 12 (+1) 13 (+1) 12 (+1) 14 (+2) Skills Stealth +5\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\nLanguages Deep Speech, Undercommon\nChallenge 8 (3,900 XP)\nDamage Transfer. While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.\nFalse Appearance. While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.\nLight Sensitivity. While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\nActions # Multiattack. The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.\nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target\u0026rsquo;s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.\nTail. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage.\nMoan. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn\u0026rsquo;t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker\u0026rsquo;s next turn. If a creature\u0026rsquo;s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker\u0026rsquo;s moan for the next 24 hours\nPhantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn\u0026rsquo;t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can\u0026rsquo;t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker\u0026rsquo;s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.\nCockatrice # Small monstrosity, unaligned\nArmor Class 11\nHit Points 27 (6d6+6)\nSpeed 20 ft., fly 40 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 6 (-2) 12 (+1) 12 (+1) 2 (-4) 13 (+1) 5 (-3) Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\nLanguages -\nChallenge 1/2 (100 XP)\nActions # Bite.

The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl\u0026rsquo;s choice).\nIn a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.

It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature\u0026rsquo;s space and stop there.

A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire\u0026rsquo;s control.\nCharm. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire.

These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.\nCustomizing NPCs # There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.\nRacial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn\u0026rsquo;t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player\u0026rsquo;s Handbook.\nSpell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC\u0026rsquo;s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn\u0026rsquo;t alter an NPC\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC\u0026rsquo;s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\nAcolyte # Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) Skills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguages any one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 1/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.

Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.\nAcolytes are junior members of a clergy, usually answerable to a priest.

Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.\nArchmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.\nAn archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage\u0026rsquo;s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.\nAssassin # Medium humanoid (any race), any non-good alignment\nArmor Class 15 (studded leather)\nHit Points 78 (12d8 + 24)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 11 (+0) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 13 (+1) 11 (+0) 10 (+0) Saving Throws Dex +6, Int +4\nSkills Acrobatics +6, Deception +3, Perception +3, Stealth +9\nDamage Resistances poison\nSenses passive Perception 13\nLanguages Thieves\u0026rsquo; cant plus any two languages\nChallenge 8 (3,900 XP)\nAssassinate.

If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.\nSneak Attack. Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated and the assassin doesn\u0026rsquo;t have disadvantage on the attack roll.\nActions # Multiattack. The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.\nShortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nLight Crossbow.

Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nTrained in the use of poison, assassins are remorseless killers who work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can afford them.\nBandit # Medium humanoid (any race), any non-lawful alignment\nArmor Class 12 (leather armor)\nHit Points 11 (2d8 + 2)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 11 (+0) 12 (+1) 12 (+1) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) Senses passive Perception 10\nLanguages any one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 1/8 (25 XP)\nActions # Scimitar.

Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.\nBandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.\nPirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation\u0026rsquo;s vessels.\nBandit Captain # Medium humanoid (any race), any non-lawful alignment\nArmor Class 15 (studded leather)\nHit Points 65 (10d8 + 20)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 15 (+2) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) 14 (+2) Saving Throws Str +4, Dex +5, Wis +2\nSkills Athletics +4, Deception +4\nSenses passive Perception 10\nLanguages any two languages\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\nActions # Multiattack.

Hit: 5 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.\nReactions # Parry. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.\nIt takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades.\nIn addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.\nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain\u0026rsquo;s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain\u0026rsquo;s colorful reputation.\nBerserker # Medium humanoid (any race), any chaotic alignment\nArmor Class 13 (hide armor)\nHit Points 67 (9d8 + 27)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 17 (+3) 9 (-1) 11 (+0) 9 (-1) Senses passive Perception 10\nLanguages any one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\nReckless.

Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage.\nCultists swear allegiance to dark powers such as elemental princes, demon lords, or archdevils. Most conceal their loyalties to avoid being ostracized, imprisoned, or executed for their beliefs. Unlike evil acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and practices.\nCult Fanatic # Medium humanoid (any race), any non-good alignment\nArmor Class 13 (leather armor)\nHit Points 33 (6d8 + 6)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 11 (+0) 14 (+2) 12 (+1) 10 (+0) 13 (+1) 14 (+2) Skills Deception +4, Persuasion +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 11\nLanguages any one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\nDark Devotion.

Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target\u0026rsquo;s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the creature\u0026rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u0026rsquo;t speak or cast spells.\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s gear melds into the new form. The target can\u0026rsquo;t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nAnimate Dead # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature\u0026rsquo;s game statistics).\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you\u0026rsquo;ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.\nAnimate Objects # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nObjects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can\u0026rsquo;t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.\nAs a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\nTable- Animate Object Stats\nSize HP AC Attack Str Dex Tiny 20 18 +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage 4 18 Small 25 16 +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage 6 14 Medium 40 13 +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage 10 12 Large 50 10 +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage 14 10 Huge 80 10 +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage 18 6 An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is\n30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.\nAntilife Shell # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.\nThe barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.\nIf you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.\nAntimagic Field # 8th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA 10-foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can\u0026rsquo;t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u0026rsquo;t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u0026rsquo;t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon\u0026rsquo;s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don\u0026rsquo;t nullify each other.\nAntipathy/Sympathy # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)\nDuration: 10 days\nThis spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura\u0026rsquo;s effect.\nAntipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can\u0026rsquo;t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can\u0026rsquo;t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\nSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can\u0026rsquo;t willingly move away from the target.\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\nEnding the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\nArcane Eye # 4th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can\u0026rsquo;t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye\u0026rsquo;s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.\nArcane Hand # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.\nThe hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn\u0026rsquo;t fill its space.\nWhen you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.\nClenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.\nForceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.\nMake a check with the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\nGrasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nInterposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can\u0026rsquo;t move through the hand\u0026rsquo;s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand\u0026rsquo;s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand\u0026rsquo;s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.\nArcane Lock # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.\nWhile affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.\nArcane Sword # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.\nWhen the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.\nArcanist\u0026rsquo;s Magic Aura # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a small square of silk)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn\u0026rsquo;t being carried or worn by another creature.\nWhen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.\nFalse Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object\u0026rsquo;s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.\nMask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin\u0026rsquo;s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.\nAstral Projection # 9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Special\nYou and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need food or air and doesn\u0026rsquo;t age.\nYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.\nThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature\u0026rsquo;s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature\u0026rsquo;s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.\nAugury # 2nd-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBy casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:\nWeal, for good results Woe, for bad results Weal and woe, for both good and bad results Nothing, for results that aren\u0026rsquo;t especially good or bad The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.\nAwaken # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 8 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAfter spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human\u0026rsquo;s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.\nThe awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.\n"},{"id":404,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-b/","title":"Spells B","section":"References","content":" Spells (B) # Bane # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nUp to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.\nBanishment # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.\nIf the target is native to the plane of existence you\u0026rsquo;re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nIf the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you\u0026rsquo;re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn\u0026rsquo;t return.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.\nBarkskin # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target\u0026rsquo;s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target\u0026rsquo;s AC can\u0026rsquo;t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.\nBeacon of Hope # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThis spell bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.\nBestow Curse # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:\nChoose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing. While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the GM\u0026rsquo;s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse\u0026rsquo;s effect.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require concentration.\nBlack Tentacles # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nSquirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.\nWhen a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.\nA creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.\nBlade Barrier # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.\nWhen a creature enters the wall\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn\u0026rsquo;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.\nAt Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.\nBlink # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nRoll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can\u0026rsquo;t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren\u0026rsquo;t there can\u0026rsquo;t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.\nBlur # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYour body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you.

The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it\u0026rsquo;s invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-­foot radius and can\u0026rsquo;t become invisible until the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\nBurning Hands # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAs you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\n"},{"id":405,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-c/","title":"Spells C","section":"References","content":" Spells (C) # Call Lightning # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can\u0026rsquo;t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can\u0026rsquo;t accommodate the cloud).\nWhen you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.\nIf you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d10.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.\nCalm Emotions # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.\nYou can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.\nAlternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.\nChain Lightning # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.\nA target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each slot level above 6th.\nCharm Person # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.\nChill Touch # Necromancy cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nYou create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can\u0026rsquo;t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.\nIf you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nCircle of Death # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.\nClairvoyance # 3rd-level divination\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 1 mile\nComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can\u0026rsquo;t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.\nA creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.\nClone # 8th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.\nAt any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return.\nThe clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original\u0026rsquo;s equipment. The original creature\u0026rsquo;s physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can\u0026rsquo;t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is elsewhere.\nCloudkill # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a 20-foot radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.\nWhen a creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe.\nThe fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\nColor Spray # 1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)\nDuration: 1 round\nA dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t see).\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.\nCommand # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 round\nYou speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.\nSome typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can\u0026rsquo;t follow your command, the spell ends.\nApproach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.\nDrop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.\nFlee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.\nGrovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.\nHalt. The target doesn\u0026rsquo;t move and takes no actions.\nA flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.\nCommune # 5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.\nDivine beings aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive \u0026ldquo;unclear\u0026rdquo; as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity\u0026rsquo;s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity\u0026rsquo;s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.\nCommune with Nature # 5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:\nterrain and bodies of water prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead influence from other planes of existence buildings For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.\nComprehend Languages # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)\nDuration: 1 hour\nFor the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.\nThis spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn\u0026rsquo;t part of a written language.\nCompulsion # 4th-­level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nCreatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect.\nA target isn\u0026rsquo;t compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.\nCone of Cold # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\nConfusion # 4th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (three nut shells)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThis spell assaults and twists creatures\u0026rsquo; minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.\nAn affected target can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\nTable- Confusion Behavior\nd10 Behavior 1 The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t take an action this turn. 2-6 The creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t move or take actions this turn. 7-8 The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. 9-10 The creature can act and move normally. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.\nConjure Animals # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:\nOne beast of challenge rating 2 or lower Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u0026rsquo;t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.\nThe GM has the creatures\u0026rsquo; statistics.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.\nConjure Celestial # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon a celestial of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The celestial disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe celestial is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.

Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don\u0026rsquo;t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\nIf your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can\u0026rsquo;t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\nThe GM has the elemental\u0026rsquo;s statistics.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.\nConjure Fey # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey spirit that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.\nConjure Minor Elementals # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range.

Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can\u0026rsquo;t take actions, can\u0026rsquo;t understand what other creatures say, can\u0026rsquo;t read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect.\nOn a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as \u0026ldquo;yes,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;no,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;maybe,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;never,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;irrelevant,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;unclear\u0026rdquo; (if the entity doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.\nContagion # 5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch Component: V, S\nDuration: 7 days\nYour touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is poisoned.\nAt the end of each of the poisoned target\u0026rsquo;s turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration.\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease\u0026rsquo;s effects apply to it.\nBlinding Sickness. Pain grips the creature\u0026rsquo;s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\nFilth Fever. A raging fever sweeps through the creature\u0026rsquo;s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.\nFlesh Rot. The creature\u0026rsquo;s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.\nMindfire. The creature\u0026rsquo;s mind becomes feverish.

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.\nSlimy Doom. The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.\nContingency # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 10 days\nChoose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.\nThe contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.\nThe contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.\nContinual Flame # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nA flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn\u0026rsquo;t use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.\nControl Water # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave\u0026rsquo;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell\u0026rsquo;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell\u0026rsquo;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn\u0026rsquo;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\nControl Weather # 8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\nYou take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.\nWhen you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.\nWhen you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.\nTable- Control Weather (Precipitation)\nStage Condition 1 Clear 2 Light clouds 3 Overcast or ground fog 4 Rain, hail, or snow 5 Torrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard Table- Control Weather (Temperature)\nStage Condition 1 Unbearable heat 2 Hot 3 Warm 4 Cool 5 Cold 6 Arctic cold Table- Control Weather (Wind)\nStage Condition 1 Calm 2 Moderate wind 3 Strong wind 4 Gale 5 Storm Counterspell # 3rd-­level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. On a success, the creature\u0026rsquo;s spell fails and has no effect.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.\nCreate Food and Water # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn\u0026rsquo;t go bad.\nCreate or Destroy Water # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou either create or destroy water.\nCreate Water. You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.\nDestroy Water. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.\nCreate Undead # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.\nCreation # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)\nDuration: Special\nYou pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within Range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object\u0026rsquo;s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nTable- Creation Duration\nMaterial Duration Vegetable matter 1 day Stone or crystal 12 hours Precious metals 1 hour Gems 10 minutes Adamantine or mithral 1 minute Using any material created by this spell as another spell\u0026rsquo;s material component causes that spell to fail.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.\nCure Wounds # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n"},{"id":406,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-d/","title":"Spells D","section":"References","content":" Spells (D) # Dancing Lights # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell\u0026rsquo;s range.\nDarkness # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nMagical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can\u0026rsquo;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can\u0026rsquo;t illuminate it.\nIf the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.\nIf any of this spell\u0026rsquo;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\nDarkvision # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\nDaylight # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nA 60-foot radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\nIf any of this spell\u0026rsquo;s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\nDeath Ward # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.\nThe first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.\nIf the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.\nDelayed Blast Fireball # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.\nIf the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.\nThe fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.\nDemiplane # 8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.\nEach time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.\nDetect Evil and Good # 1st-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDetect Magic # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDetect Poison and Disease # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a yew leaf)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDetect Thoughts # 2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a copper piece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nFor the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.\nYou initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature\u0026rsquo;s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature\u0026rsquo;s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.\nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can\u0026rsquo;t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can\u0026rsquo;t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak any language.\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can\u0026rsquo;t see it, but it must still be within range.\nDimension Door # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as \u0026ldquo;200 feet straight downward\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.\u0026rdquo;\nYou can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\u0026rsquo;t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.\nIf you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.\nDisguise Self # 1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou make yourself-including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person- look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can\u0026rsquo;t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\nDisintegrate # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.\nA creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.\nA disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.\nThis spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.\nDispel Evil and Good # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nShimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\nYou can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.\nBreak Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.\nDismissal. As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn\u0026rsquo;t there already). If they aren\u0026rsquo;t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.\nDispel Magic # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nChoose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell\u0026rsquo;s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.\nDivination # 4th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYour magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god\u0026rsquo;s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\nThe spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.\nDivine Favor # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYour prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the spell ends, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.\nDivine Word # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:\n50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn\u0026rsquo;t there already) and can\u0026rsquo;t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a wish spell. Dominate Beast # 4th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.\nWhile the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \u0026ldquo;Attack that creature,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run over there,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Fetch that object.\u0026rdquo; If the creature completes the order and doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything that you don\u0026rsquo;t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.\nDominate Monster # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.\nWhile the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \u0026ldquo;Attack that creature,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run over there,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Fetch that object.\u0026rdquo; If the creature completes the order and doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything that you don\u0026rsquo;t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.\nDominate Person # 5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.\nWhile the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \u0026ldquo;Attack that creature,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run over there,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Fetch that object.\u0026rdquo; If the creature completes the order and doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything that you don\u0026rsquo;t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.\nDream # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Special\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)\nDuration: 8 hours\nThis spell shapes a creature\u0026rsquo;s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t sleep, such as elves, can\u0026rsquo;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can\u0026rsquo;t take actions or move.\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target\u0026rsquo;s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target\u0026rsquo;s dreams.\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target\u0026rsquo;s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target\u0026rsquo;s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.\nDruidcraft # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWhispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:\nYou create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round. You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom. You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube. You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.\nThe ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.\nEach creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\u0026rsquo;s concentration is broken.\nWhen you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.\nThis spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.\nFissures. Fissures open throughout the spell\u0026rsquo;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell\u0026rsquo;s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure\u0026rsquo;s edge as it opens.\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).\nStructures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure\u0026rsquo;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall prone or become buried.\nEldritch Blast # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.\nThe spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.\nEnhance Ability # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour.\nYou touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.\nBear\u0026rsquo;s Endurance. The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.\nBull\u0026rsquo;s Strength. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.\nCat\u0026rsquo;s Grace. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated.\nEagle\u0026rsquo;s Splendor. The target has advantage on Charisma checks.\nFox\u0026rsquo;s Cunning. The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.\nOwl\u0026rsquo;s Wisdom. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.\nEnlarge/Reduce # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.\nIf the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.\nEnlarge. The target\u0026rsquo;s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u0026rsquo;s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target\u0026rsquo;s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.\nReduce. The target\u0026rsquo;s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category-from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u0026rsquo;s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target\u0026rsquo;s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can\u0026rsquo;t reduce the damage below 1).\nEntangle # 1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nGrasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.\nA creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.\nWhen the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.\nEnthrall # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.\nEtherealness # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 8 hours\nYou step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can\u0026rsquo;t see anything more than 60 feet away.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren\u0026rsquo;t on the Ethereal Plane can\u0026rsquo;t perceive you and can\u0026rsquo;t interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.\nYou ignore all objects and effects that aren\u0026rsquo;t on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.\nWhen the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.\nThis spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn\u0026rsquo;t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.\nExpeditious Retreat # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nThis spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take the Dash action.\nEyebite # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nFor the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can\u0026rsquo;t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.\nAsleep. The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.\nPanicked. The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.\nSickened. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.\n"},{"id":408,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-f/","title":"Spells F","section":"References","content":" Spells (F) # Fabricate # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.\nChoose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.\nCreatures or magic items can\u0026rsquo;t be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can\u0026rsquo;t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan\u0026rsquo;s tools used to craft such objects.\nFaerie Fire # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nEach object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAny attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from being invisible.\nFaithful Hound # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.\nThe hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can\u0026rsquo;t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.\nAt the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound\u0026rsquo;s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.\nFalse Life # 1st-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)\nDuration: 1 hour\nBolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.\nAt Higher Levels.

Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.\nWhile frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\nFeather Fall # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a small feather or piece of down)\nDuration: 1 minute\nChoose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature\u0026rsquo;s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.\nFeeblemind # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the creature\u0026rsquo;s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.\nAt the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.\nThe spell can also be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish.\nFind Familiar # 1st-­level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\nYour familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can\u0026rsquo;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\nWhen the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.\nWhile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar\u0026rsquo;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\nAs an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.\nFind Steed # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.\nFind the Path # 6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools- such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes-worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 day\nThis spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn\u0026rsquo;t specific (such as \u0026ldquo;a green dragon\u0026rsquo;s lair\u0026rdquo;), the spell fails.\nFor the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.\nFind Traps # 2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.\nThis spell merely reveals that a trap is present.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.\nFinger of Death # 7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.\nFireball # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\nFire Bolt # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).\nFire Shield # 4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)\nDuration: 10 minutes\nThin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.\nThe flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.\nIn addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.\nFire Storm # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.\nFlame Blade # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (leaf of sumac)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.\nYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.\nThe flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\nAt Higher Levels.

Each creature in a 10-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.\nFlaming Sphere # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA 5-foot diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere\u0026rsquo;s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.\nWhen you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\nFlesh to Stone # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target\u0026rsquo;s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn\u0026rsquo;t affected.\nA creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\nIf the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.\nFloating Disk # 1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.\nThe disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can\u0026rsquo;t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can\u0026rsquo;t move across a 10-foot deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.\nIf you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can\u0026rsquo;t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\nFly # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.\nFog Cloud # 1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.\nForbiddance # 6th-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)\nDuration: 1 day\nYou create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can\u0026rsquo;t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the plane shift spell.\nIn addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s area can\u0026rsquo;t overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.\nForcecage # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour\nAn immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.\nA prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.\nA prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.\nWhen you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage\u0026rsquo;s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.\nA creature inside the cage can\u0026rsquo;t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can\u0026rsquo;t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.\nThis spell can\u0026rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel magic.\nForesight # 9th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can\u0026rsquo;t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.\nThis spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.\nFreedom of Movement # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target\u0026rsquo;s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target\u0026rsquo;s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target\u0026rsquo;s movement or attacks.\nFreezing Sphere # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling\u0026rsquo;s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn\u0026rsquo;t already shattered, it explodes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.\n"},{"id":409,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-g/","title":"Spells G","section":"References","content":" Spells (G) # Gaseous Form # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it\u0026rsquo;s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn\u0026rsquo;t affected.\nWhile in this form, the target\u0026rsquo;s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can\u0026rsquo;t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can\u0026rsquo;t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can\u0026rsquo;t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can\u0026rsquo;t attack or cast spells.\nGate # 9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.\nThe portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn\u0026rsquo;t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature\u0026rsquo;s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.\nGeas # 5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 30 days\nYou place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can\u0026rsquo;t understand you is unaffected by the spell.\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.\nGentle Repose # 2nd-level necromancy (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse\u0026rsquo;s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)\nDuration: 10 days\nYou touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can\u0026rsquo;t become undead.\nThe spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don\u0026rsquo;t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.\nGiant Insect # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.\nEach creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.\nA creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.\nThe GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.\nGlibness # 8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 hour\nUntil the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.\nGlobe of Invulnerability # 6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nAn immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\nAny spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can\u0026rsquo;t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.\nGlyph of Warding # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.\nGoodberry # 1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nUp to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.\nThe berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.\nGrease # 1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)\nDuration: 1 minute\nSlick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.\nWhen the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.\nGreater Invisibility # 4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target\u0026rsquo;s person.\nGreater Restoration # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target\u0026rsquo;s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:\nOne effect that charmed or petrified the target One curse, including the target\u0026rsquo;s attunement to a cursed magic item Any reduction to one of the target\u0026rsquo;s ability scores One effect reducing the target\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum Guardian of Faith # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 8 hours\nA large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.\nAny creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has delat a total of 60 damage.\nGuards and Wards # 6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.\nGuards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\nCorridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.\nDoors. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.\nStairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.\nOther Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\nPlace dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts. Place magic mouth in two locations. Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts. Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room. Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.\nYou can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.\nGuidance # Divination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.\nGuiding Bolt # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nA flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\nGust of Wind # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a legume seed)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.\nAny creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.\nThe gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\n"},{"id":410,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-h/","title":"Spells H","section":"References","content":" Spells (H) # Hallow # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 24 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.\nFirst, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can\u0026rsquo;t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.\nSecond, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.\nCourage. Affected creatures can\u0026rsquo;t be frightened while in the area.\nDarkness. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can\u0026rsquo;t illuminate the area.\nDaylight. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can\u0026rsquo;t extinguish the light.\nEnergy Protection. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.\nEnergy Vulnerability. Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.\nEverlasting Rest. Dead bodies interred in the area can\u0026rsquo;t be turned into undead.\nExtradimensional Interference. Affected creatures can\u0026rsquo;t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.\nFear. Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.\nSilence. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.\nTongues. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t share a common language.\nHallucinatory Terrain # 4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren\u0026rsquo;t changed in appearance.\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.\nHarm # 6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can\u0026rsquo;t reduce the target\u0026rsquo;s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.\nHaste # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nChoose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target\u0026rsquo;s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.\nWhen the spell ends, the target can\u0026rsquo;t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.\nHeal # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nChoose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This spell also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th.\nHealing Word # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.\nHeat Metal # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nChoose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.\nIf a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.\nAt Higher Levels.

To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.\nShould the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.\nA creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\nImprisonment # 9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range.

The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can\u0026rsquo;t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can\u0026rsquo;t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\u0026rsquo;s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.\nIncendiary Cloud # 8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range.

The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere\u0026rsquo;s area is difficult terrain.\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw.

The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.\nAt any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item\u0026rsquo;s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.\nIf another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn\u0026rsquo;t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.\nDispel magic or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell\u0026rsquo;s effect.\nInvisibility # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.

Creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this spell.\nA dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself.

The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn\u0026rsquo;t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.\nThe information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: \u0026ldquo;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.

You can change the target\u0026rsquo;s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell\u0026rsquo;s range.\nWhen the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.\nLight # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.

While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container\u0026rsquo;s space. You can\u0026rsquo;t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.\nYou can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can\u0026rsquo;t be possessed).

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can\u0026rsquo;t use any of its class features.\nMeanwhile, the possessed creature\u0026rsquo;s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can\u0026rsquo;t move or take actions at all.\nWhile possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature\u0026rsquo;s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you\u0026rsquo;re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.\nIf the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet.

Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object\u0026rsquo;s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\nMagic Weapon # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.\nMagnificent Mansion # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.\nBeyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\nYou can create any floor plan you like, but the space can\u0026rsquo;t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can\u0026rsquo;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can\u0026rsquo;t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\nMajor Image # 3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can\u0026rsquo;t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte\u0026rsquo;s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\nMass Cure Wounds # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\nMass Heal # 9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nMass Healing Word # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAs you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.\nMass Suggestion # 6th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake\u0026rsquo;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met before the spell ends, the activity isn\u0026rsquo;t performed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.\nMaze # 8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.\nThe target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).\nWhen the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.\nMeld into Stone # 3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.\nWhile merged with the stone, you can\u0026rsquo;t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can\u0026rsquo;t move.\nMinor physical damage to the stone doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone\u0026rsquo;s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.\nMending # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (two lodestones)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can\u0026rsquo;t restore magic to such an object.\nMessage # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.\nMeteor Swarm # 9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 1 mile\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBlazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.\nThe spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nMind Blank # 8th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 24 hours\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition. The spell even foils wish spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target\u0026rsquo;s mind or to gain information about the target.\nMinor Illusion # Illusion cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else\u0026rsquo;s voice, a lion\u0026rsquo;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\nIf you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can\u0026rsquo;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.\nMirage Arcane # 7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Sight\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 days\nYou make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain\u0026rsquo;s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.\nSimilarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.\nThe illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell\u0026rsquo;s area disappears immediately.\nCreatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain\u0026rsquo;s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion\u0026rsquo;s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.\nMirror Image # 2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nThree illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack\u0026rsquo;s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\nA duplicate\u0026rsquo;s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can\u0026rsquo;t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.\nMislead # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.\nYou can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.\nMisty Step # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.\nModify Memory # 5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to reshape another creature\u0026rsquo;s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target\u0026rsquo;s memories are modified.\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target\u0026rsquo;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature\u0026rsquo;s memory isn\u0026rsquo;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.\nA modified memory doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature\u0026rsquo;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.\nA remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature\u0026rsquo;s true memory.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target\u0026rsquo;s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature\u0026rsquo;s past (9th level).\nMoonbeam # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.\nWhen a creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can\u0026rsquo;t assume a different form until it leaves the spell\u0026rsquo;s light.\nOn each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.\nMove Earth # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils-clay, loam, and sand)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 2 hours\nChoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area\u0026rsquo;s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can\u0026rsquo;t exceed half the area\u0026rsquo;s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square\u0026rsquo;s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\nAt the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\nBecause the terrain\u0026rsquo;s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can\u0026rsquo;t usually be trapped or injured by the ground\u0026rsquo;s movement.\nThis spell can\u0026rsquo;t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.\nSimilarly, this spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.\n"},{"id":416,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-n/","title":"Spells N","section":"References","content":" Spells (N) # Nondetection # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 8 hours\nFor the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\n"},{"id":417,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-o/","title":"Spells O","section":"References","content":" Spells (O) # none.\n"},{"id":418,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-p/","title":"Spells P","section":"References","content":" Spells (P) # Pass without Trace # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can\u0026rsquo;t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.\nPasswall # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)\nDuration: 1 hour\nA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening\u0026rsquo;s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.\nWhen the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.\nPhantasmal Killer # 4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target\u0026rsquo;s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.\nPhantom Steed # 3rd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nA Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature\u0026rsquo;s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.\nFor the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.\nPlanar Ally # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature\u0026rsquo;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM\u0026rsquo;s choice).\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature\u0026rsquo;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature\u0026rsquo;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.\nPlanar Binding # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 24 hours\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell\u0026rsquo;s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.\nA bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.\nPlane Shift # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nAlternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.\nYou can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\nPlant Growth # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.\nIf you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.\nYou can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell\u0026rsquo;s area from being affected.\nIf you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.\nPoison Spray # Conjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).\nPolymorph # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target\u0026rsquo;s (or the target\u0026rsquo;s level, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a challenge rating). The target\u0026rsquo;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the creature\u0026rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u0026rsquo;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nPower Word Kill # 9th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\nPower Word Stun # 8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\nThe stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.\nPrayer of Healing # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nUp to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\nPrestidigitation # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 1 hour\nThis spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within Range:\nYou create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot. You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\nPrismatic Spray # 7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nEight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.\nRed. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Orange. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Yellow. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Green. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Blue. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Indigo. On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn\u0026rsquo;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) Special. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8. Prismatic Wall # 9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nThe spell no longer refers to a rod of cancellation, and the text clarifies that dispel magic works only against the violet layer.\nA shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall\u0026rsquo;s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer\u0026rsquo;s properties as described below.\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on it.\nRed. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\u0026rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can\u0026rsquo;t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn\u0026rsquo;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects. Private Sanctum # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\nSound can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it. Sensors created by divination spells can\u0026rsquo;t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter. Creatures in the area can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by divination spells. Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\nProduce Flame # Conjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nA flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.\nYou can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nProgrammed Illusion # 6th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\nProject Image # 7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 miles\nComponents: V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 day\nYou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A\ncreature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\nProtection from Energy # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nFor the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\nProtection from Evil and Good # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration up to 10 minutes\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.\nThe protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.\nProtection from Poison # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.\nFor the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.\nPurify Food and Drink # 1st-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAll nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.\n"},{"id":419,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-q/","title":"Spells Q","section":"References","content":" Spells (Q) # None.\n"},{"id":420,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-r/","title":"Spells R","section":"References","content":" Spells (R) # Raise Dead # 5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.\nThis spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren\u0026rsquo;t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can\u0026rsquo;t return an undead creature to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\nRay of Enfeeblement # 2nd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.\nAt the end of each of the target\u0026rsquo;s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.\nRay of Frost # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nRegenerate # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.\nReincarnate # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.\nIf the target\u0026rsquo;s soul isn\u0026rsquo;t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.\nThe magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature\u0026rsquo;s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.\nTable- Reincarnate Race\nd100 Race 01-04 Dragonborn 05-13 Dwarf, hill 14-21 Dwarf, mountain 22-25 Elf, dark 26-34 Elf, high 35-42 Elf, wood 43-46 Gnome, forest 47-52 Gnome, rock 53-56 Half-elf 57-60 Half-orc 61-68 Halfling, lightfoot 69-76 Halfling, stout 77-96 Human 97-00 Tiefling The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.\nRemove Curse # 3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAt your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner\u0026rsquo;s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.\nResilient Sphere # 4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.\nNothing-not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects-can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can\u0026rsquo;t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.\nThe sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere\u0026rsquo;s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature\u0026rsquo;s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.\nA disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.\nResistance # Abjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature cloak)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.\nResurrection # 7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn\u0026rsquo;t die of old age, and that isn\u0026rsquo;t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.\nThis spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren\u0026rsquo;t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\nCasting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can\u0026rsquo;t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.\nReverse Gravity # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThis spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.\nIf some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.\nAt the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.\nRevivify # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can\u0026rsquo;t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.\nRope Trick # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.\nThe extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.\nAttacks and spells can\u0026rsquo;t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.\nAnything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.\n"},{"id":421,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-s/","title":"Spells S","section":"References","content":" Spells (S) # Sacred Flame # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nFlame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nSanctuary # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.\nIf the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.\nScorching Ray # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.\nMake a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.\nScrying # 5th-level divination\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you\u0026rsquo;re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.\nTable- Scrying Save Modifier\nKnowledge Save Modifier Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5 Firsthand (you have met the target) +0 Familiar (you know the target well) -5 Connection Save Modifier Likeness or picture -2 Possession or garment -4 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like -10 On a successful save, the target isn\u0026rsquo;t affected, and you can\u0026rsquo;t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.\nOn a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn\u0026rsquo;t move.\nSecret Chest # 4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).\nWhile the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.\nAfter 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.\nSee Invisibility # 2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)\nDuration: 1 hour\nFor the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.\nSeeming # 5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nThis spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can\u0026rsquo;t change a target\u0026rsquo;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature\u0026rsquo;s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature\u0026rsquo;s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.\nSending # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Unlimited\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.\nYou can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t arrive.\nSequester # 7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nBy means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.\nIf the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t grow older.\nYou can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \u0026ldquo;after 1,000 years\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;when the tarrasque awakens.\u0026rdquo; This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.\nShapechange # 9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature\u0026rsquo;s bonus in place of yours. You can\u0026rsquo;t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can\u0026rsquo;t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u0026rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn\u0026rsquo;t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\u0026rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\nDuring this spell\u0026rsquo;s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.\nShatter # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a chip of mica)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.\nA nonmagical object that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it\u0026rsquo;s in the spell\u0026rsquo;s area.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\nShield # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nAn invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.\nShield of Faith # 1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.\nShillelagh # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)\nDuration: 1 minute\nThe wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature\u0026rsquo;s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon\u0026rsquo;s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.\nShocking Grasp # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nLightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can\u0026rsquo;t take reactions until the start of its next turn.\nThe spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nSilence # 2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.\nSilent Image # 1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn\u0026rsquo;t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.\nSimulacrum # 7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 12 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature\u0026rsquo;s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature\u0026rsquo;s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.\nThe simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.\nIf the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.\nIf you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.\nSleep # 1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)\nDuration: 1 minute\nThis spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u0026rsquo;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\nUndead and creatures immune to being charmed aren\u0026rsquo;t affected by this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.\nSleet Storm # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nUntil the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.\nThe ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.\nIf a creature starts its turn in the spell\u0026rsquo;s area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.\nSlow # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of molasses)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.\nAn affected target\u0026rsquo;s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can\u0026rsquo;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature\u0026rsquo;s abilities or magic items, it can\u0026rsquo;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\nIf the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t take effect until the creature\u0026rsquo;s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can\u0026rsquo;t, the spell is wasted.\nA creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.\nSpare the Dying # Necromancy cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nSpeak with Animals # 1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nSpeak with Dead # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense)\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can\u0026rsquo;t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.\nUntil the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t return the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can\u0026rsquo;t learn new information, doesn\u0026rsquo;t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can\u0026rsquo;t speculate about future events.\nSpeak with Plants # 3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (30-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell\u0026rsquo;s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion. The spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.\nIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.\nThis spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.\nSpider Climb # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.\nSpike Growth # 2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nThe ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.\nThe transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can\u0026rsquo;t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.\nSpirit Guardians # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (a holy symbol)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature\u0026rsquo;s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.\nSpiritual Weapon # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.\nThe weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell\u0026rsquo;s effect resemble that weapon.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.\nStinking Cloud # 3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a 20-foot radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.\nEach creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\nA moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.\nStone Shape # 4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn\u0026rsquo;t possible.\nStoneskin # 4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nThis spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\nStorm of Vengeance # 9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Sight\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.\nEach round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces different effects on your turn.\nRound 2. Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.\nRound 3. You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can\u0026rsquo;t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nRound 4. Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.\nRound 5-10. Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.\nSuggestion # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake\u0026rsquo;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can\u0026rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.\nThe target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met before the spell expires, the activity isn\u0026rsquo;t performed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.\nSunbeam # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot wide, 60-foot long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\nYou can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.\nFor the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.\nSunburst # 8th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBrilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\nA creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.\nThis spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.\nSymbol # 7th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature\u0026rsquo;s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don\u0026rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\nDeath. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nDiscord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\nFear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\nHopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can\u0026rsquo;t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\nInsanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can\u0026rsquo;t take actions, can\u0026rsquo;t understand what other creatures say, can\u0026rsquo;t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.\nPain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\nSleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\nStunning. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.\n"},{"id":422,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-t/","title":"Spells T","section":"References","content":" Spells (T) # Telekinesis # 5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.\nCreature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature\u0026rsquo;s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.\nOn subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.\nObject. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.\nIf the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature\u0026rsquo;s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.\nYou can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.\nTelepathic Bond # 5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren\u0026rsquo;t affected by this spell.\nUntil the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can\u0026rsquo;t extend to other planes of existence.\nTeleport # 7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can\u0026rsquo;t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.\nTable- Teleport Familiarity\nFamiliarity Mishap Similar Area Off Target On Target Permanent circle - - - 01-100 Associated object - - - 01-100 Very familiar 01-05 06-13 14-24 25-100 Seen casually 01-33 34-43 44-53 54-100 Viewed once 01-43 44-53 54-73 74-100 Description 01-43 44-53 54-73 74-100 False destination 01-50 51-100 - - Familiarity. \u0026ldquo;Permanent circle\u0026rdquo; means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \u0026ldquo;Associated object\u0026rdquo; means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard\u0026rsquo;s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich\u0026rsquo;s secret tomb.\n\u0026ldquo;Very familiar\u0026rdquo; is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \u0026ldquo;Seen casually\u0026rdquo; is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren\u0026rsquo;t very familiar. \u0026ldquo;Viewed once\u0026rdquo; is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \u0026ldquo;Description\u0026rdquo; is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else\u0026rsquo;s description, perhaps from a map.\n\u0026ldquo;False destination\u0026rdquo; is a place that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy\u0026rsquo;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\nOn Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u0026rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\u0026rsquo;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\nMishap. The spell\u0026rsquo;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\nTeleportation Circle # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 round\nAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nMany major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.\nYou can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.\nThaumaturgy # Transmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Up to 1 minute\nYou manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within Range:\nYour voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute. You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute. You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute. You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers. You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut. You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action. Thunderwave # 1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cube)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t pushed.\nIn addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\nTime Stop # 9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.\nThis spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.\nTiny Hut # 3rd-level evocation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self (10-foot radius hemisphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal bead)\nDuration: 8 hours\nA 10-foot radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can\u0026rsquo;t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.\nTongues # 3rd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.\nTransport via Plants # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nThis spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\nTree Stride # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you\u0026rsquo;re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.\nTrue Polymorph # 9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nChoose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn\u0026rsquo;t affected by this spell.\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target\u0026rsquo;s (or its level, if the target doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a challenge rating). The target\u0026rsquo;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the creature\u0026rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u0026rsquo;t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u0026rsquo;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target\u0026rsquo;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can\u0026rsquo;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature\u0026rsquo;s size is no larger than the object\u0026rsquo;s size and the creature\u0026rsquo;s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature\u0026rsquo;s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object\u0026rsquo;s size is no larger than the creature\u0026rsquo;s size. The creature\u0026rsquo;s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.\nTrue Resurrection # 9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature\u0026rsquo;s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.\nThis spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.\nThe spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature\u0026rsquo;s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.\nTrue Seeing # 6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.\nTrue Strike # Divination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round\nYou extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target\u0026rsquo;s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn\u0026rsquo;t ended.\n"},{"id":423,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-u/","title":"Spells U","section":"References","content":" Spells (U) # Unseen Servant # 1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can\u0026rsquo;t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.\n"},{"id":424,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-v/","title":"Spells V","section":"References","content":" Spells (V) # Vampiric Touch # 3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThe touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\nVicious Mockery # Enchantment cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.\nThis spell\u0026rsquo;s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).\n"},{"id":425,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-w/","title":"Spells W","section":"References","content":" Spells (W) # Wall of Fire # 4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nOne side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\nWall of Force # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nAn invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature\u0026rsquo;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can\u0026rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\nWall of Ice # 6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature\u0026rsquo;s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.\nWall of Stone # 5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small block of granite)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature\u0026rsquo;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can\u0026rsquo;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can\u0026rsquo;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\nWall of Thorns # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.\nWarding Bond # 2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.\nWater Breathing # 3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)\nDuration: 24 hours\nThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.\nWater Walk # 3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cork)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.\nIf you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.\nWeb # 2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.\nIf the webs aren\u0026rsquo;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.\nWeird # 9th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to one minute\nDrawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature\u0026rsquo;s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature\u0026rsquo;s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\nWind Walk # 6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (fire and holy water)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can\u0026rsquo;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can\u0026rsquo;t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.\nWind Wall # 3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can\u0026rsquo;t pass through it.\nWish # 9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\nYou create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u0026rsquo;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\u0026rsquo;s life drain attack. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u0026rsquo;s successful save, a foe\u0026rsquo;s critical hit, or a friend\u0026rsquo;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u0026rsquo;s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u0026rsquo;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.\nWord of Recall # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 5 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn\u0026rsquo;t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.\n"},{"id":426,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-x/","title":"Spells X","section":"References","content":" Spells (X) # None.\n"},{"id":427,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-y/","title":"Spells Y","section":"References","content":" Spells (Y) # None.\n"},{"id":428,"href":"/references/spells-alt/spells-z/","title":"Spells Z","section":"References","content":" Spells (Z) # Zone of Truth # 2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can\u0026rsquo;t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.\nAn affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.\n"},{"id":429,"href":"/references/spells/acid-arrow/","title":"Acid Arrow","section":"References","content":" Acid Arrow # 2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder\u0026rsquo;s stomach)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid.

You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\nChange Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can\u0026rsquo;t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u0026rsquo;t protrude into it.

The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u0026rsquo;t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon\u0026rsquo;s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.

Fissures open throughout the spell\u0026rsquo;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell\u0026rsquo;s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure\u0026rsquo;s edge as it opens.\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).\nStructures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure\u0026rsquo;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall prone or become buried.\n"},{"id":524,"href":"/references/spells/eldritch-blast/","title":"Eldritch Blast","section":"References","content":" Eldritch Blast # Evocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range.

The extent of any such changes can\u0026rsquo;t exceed half the area\u0026rsquo;s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square\u0026rsquo;s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\nAt the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\nBecause the terrain\u0026rsquo;s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can\u0026rsquo;t usually be trapped or injured by the ground\u0026rsquo;s movement.\nThis spell can\u0026rsquo;t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.\nSimilarly, this spell doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly affect plant growth.

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature\u0026rsquo;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM\u0026rsquo;s choice).\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature\u0026rsquo;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature\u0026rsquo;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.\n"},{"id":647,"href":"/references/spells/planar-binding/","title":"Planar Binding","section":"References","content":" Planar Binding # 5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 24 hours\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service.

You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u0026rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\u0026rsquo;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\nMishap. The spell\u0026rsquo;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\n"},{"id":718,"href":"/references/spells/teleportation-circle/","title":"Teleportation Circle","section":"References","content":" Teleportation Circle # 5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 round\nAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you.

You don\u0026rsquo;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\nYou create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u0026rsquo;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\u0026rsquo;s life drain attack. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u0026rsquo;s successful save, a foe\u0026rsquo;s critical hit, or a friend\u0026rsquo;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u0026rsquo;s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u0026rsquo;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.\n"},{"id":746,"href":"/references/spells/word-of-recall/","title":"Word of Recall","section":"References","content":" Word of Recall # 6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 5 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.

Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell\u0026rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can\u0026rsquo;t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius.

While you\u0026rsquo;re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.\nAmmunition, +1, +2, or +3 # Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.\nAmulet of Health # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYour Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.\nAmulet of Proof against Detection and Location # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\nAmulet of the Planes # Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.\nAnimated Shield # Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.\nApparatus of the Crab # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\nArmor Class 20\nHit Points 200\nSpeed 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren\u0026rsquo;t extended)\nDamage Immunities poison, psychic\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus\u0026rsquo;s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus\u0026rsquo;s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.\nTable- Apparatus of the Crab\nLever Up Down 1 Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus\u0026rsquo;s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed. 2 Forward window shutter opens. Forward window shutter closes. 3 Side window shutters open (two per side). Side window shutters close (two per side). 4 Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.

The bonus is determined by its rarity.\nArmor of Invulnerability # Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nArmor of Resistance # Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.\nTable- Armor of Resistance\nd10 Damage Type 1 Acid 2 Cold 3 Fire 4 Force 5 Lightning 6 Necrotic 7 Poison 8 Psychic 9 Radiant 10 Thunder Armor of Vulnerability # Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.\nCurse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).\nArrow-Catching Shield # Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield\u0026rsquo;s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.\nArrow of Slaying # Weapon (arrow), very rare\nAn arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\nOnce an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.\nOther types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.\n"},{"id":749,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-b/","title":"Magic Items B","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (B) # Bag of Beans # Wondrous item, rare\nInside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.\nIf you dump the bag\u0026rsquo;s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nIf you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.\nTable- Bag of Beans\nd100 Effect 01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour. 02-10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM\u0026rsquo;s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds. 11-20 A treant sprouts. There\u0026rsquo;s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks. 21-30 An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. 31-40 A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished). 41-50 1d6+6 shriekers sprout. 51-60 1d4+8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke. 61-70 A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. 71-80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10+20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. 81-90 A nest of 1d4+3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. 91-99 A pyramid with a 60-foot square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord\u0026rsquo;s lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. 100 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant\u0026rsquo;s castle, or a different plane of existence. Bag of Devouring # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.\nThe extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn\u0026rsquo;t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.\nInanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.\nBag of Holding # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.\nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\nPlacing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can\u0026rsquo;t be reopened.\nBag of Tricks # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.\nYou can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag\u0026rsquo;s color.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.\nOnce three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nTable- Gray Bag of Tricks\nd8 Creature 1 Weasel 2 Giant rat 3 Badger 4 Boar 5 Panther 6 Giant badger 7 Dire wolf 8 Giant elk Table- Rust Bag of Tricks\nd8 Creature 1 Rat 2 Owl 3 Mastiff 4 Goat 5 Giant goat 6 Giant boar 7 Lion 8 Brown bear Table- Tan Bag of Tricks\nd8 Creature 1 Jackal 2 Ape 3 Baboon 4 Axe beak 5 Black bear 6 Giant weasel 7 Giant hyena 8 Tiger Bead of Force # Wondrous item, rare\nThis small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4+4 beads of force are found together.\nYou can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere\u0026rsquo;s wall. No attack or other effect can.\nAn enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere\u0026rsquo;s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature\u0026rsquo;s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.\nBelt of Dwarvenkind # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:\nYour Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves. In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you\u0026rsquo;re capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:\nYou have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish. Belt of Giant Strength # Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt\u0026rsquo;s score, the item has no effect on you.\nSix varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant strength look different, but they have the same effect.\nTable- Belt of Strength\nType Strength Rarity Hill giant 21 Rare Stone/frost giant 23 Very rare Fire giant 25 Very rare Cloud giant 27 Legendary Storm giant 29 Legendary Berserker Axe # Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.\nCurse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nWhenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nBoots of Elvenkind # Wondrous item, uncommon\nWhile you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.\nBoots of Levitation # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use an action to cast the levitate spell on yourself at will.\nBoots of Speed # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots\u0026rsquo; heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.\nWhen the boots\u0026rsquo; property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.\nBoots of Striding and Springing # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn\u0026rsquo;t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can\u0026rsquo;t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.\nBoots of the Winterlands # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:\nYou have resistance to cold damage. You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.

The broom stops hovering when you land.\nYou can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place.

After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle\u0026rsquo;s total burn time.\nWhile lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle\u0026rsquo;s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell\u0026rsquo;s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it.

While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell\u0026rsquo;s sensor.\nCube of Force # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.\nYou can use an action to press one of the cube\u0026rsquo;s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube\u0026rsquo;s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier\u0026rsquo;s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.\nIf your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the cube, you can\u0026rsquo;t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.\nTable- Cube of Force Effects\nFace Charges Effect 1 1 Gases, wind, and fog can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. 2 2 Nonliving matter can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. 3 3 Living matter can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. 4 4 Spell effects can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the barrier. 5 5 Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. 6 0 The barrier deactivates. The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.\nTable- Cube of Force Charges Lost\nSpell or Item Charges Lost Disintegrate 1d12 Horn of blasting 1d10 Passwall 1d6 Prismatic spray 1d20 Wall of fire 1d4 Cubic Gate # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.\nYou can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.\nThe cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n"},{"id":751,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-d/","title":"Magic Items D","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (D) # Dagger of Venom # Weapon (dagger), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nYou can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can\u0026rsquo;t be used this way again until the next dawn.\nDancing Sword # Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.\nWhile the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\nAfter the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.\nDecanter of Endless Water # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.\nYou can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:\n\u0026ldquo;Stream\u0026rdquo; produces 1 gallon of water. \u0026ldquo;Fountain\u0026rdquo; produces 5 gallons of water. \u0026ldquo;Geyser\u0026rdquo; produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you. Deck of Illusions # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20-1 cards.\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can\u0026rsquo;t be used again.\nTable- Deck of Illusions\nPlaying Card Illusion Ace of hearts Red dragon King of hearts Knight and four guards Queen of hearts Succubus or incubus Jack of hearts Druid Ten of hearts Cloud giant Nine of hearts Ettin Eight of hearts Bugbear Two of hearts Goblin Ace of diamonds Beholder King of diamonds Archmage and mage apprentice Queen of diamonds Night hag Jack of diamonds Assassin Ten of diamonds Fire giant Nine of diamonds Ogre mage Eight of diamonds Gnoll Two of diamonds Kobold Ace of spades Lich King of spades Priest and two acolytes Queen of spades Medusa Jack of spades Veteran Ten of spades Frost giant Nine of spades Troll Eight of spades Hobgoblin Two of spades Goblin Ace of clubs Iron golem King of clubs Bandit captain and three bandits Queen of clubs Erinyes Jack of clubs Berserker Ten of clubs Hill giant Nine of clubs Ogre Eight of clubs Orc Two of clubs Kobold Jokers (2) You (the deck\u0026rsquo;s owner) Deck of Many Things # Wondrous item, legendary\nUsually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\nTable- Deck of Many Things\nPlaying Card Card Ace of diamonds Vizier* King of diamonds Sun Queen of diamonds Moon Jack of diamonds Star Two of diamonds Comet* Ace of hearts The Fates* King of hearts Throne Queen of hearts Key Jack of hearts Knight Two of hearts Gem* Ace of clubs Talons* King of clubs The Void Queen of clubs Flames Jack of clubs Skull Two of clubs Idiot* Ace of spades Donjon* King of spades Ruin Queen of spades Euryale Jack of spades Rogue Two of spades Balance* Joker (with TM) Fool* Joker (without TM) Jester * Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\nBalance.

If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\nDonjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can\u0026rsquo;t be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\nEuryale. The card\u0026rsquo;s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\nThe Fates. Reality\u0026rsquo;s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card\u0026rsquo;s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\nFlames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\nFool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\nGem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\nIdiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4+1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\nJester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\nKey. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\nKnight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\nMoon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\nRogue. A nonplayer character of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn\u0026rsquo;t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC\u0026rsquo;s hostility toward you.\nRuin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\nSkull. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can\u0026rsquo;t be restored to life.\nAvatar of Death # Medium undead, neutral evil\nArmor Class 20\nHit Points half the hit point maximum of its summoner\nSpeed 60 ft., fly 60 ft.

Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren\u0026rsquo;t destroyed but do vanish.\nThrone. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nVizier. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nThe Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can\u0026rsquo;t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\nDefender # Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword\u0026rsquo;s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\nDemon Armor # Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor\u0026rsquo;s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.\nCurse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can\u0026rsquo;t doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.\nDimensional Shackles # Wondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don\u0026rsquo;t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.\nYou and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.\nDragon Scale Mail # Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)\nDragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).\nAdditionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nTable- Dragon Scale Mail\nDragon Resistance Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold Dragon Slayer # Weapon (any sword), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nWhen you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon\u0026rsquo;s type. For the purpose of this weapon, \u0026ldquo;dragon\u0026rdquo; refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.\nDust of Disappearance # Wondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.\nDust of Dryness # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis small packet contains 1d6+4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet\u0026rsquo;s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet\u0026rsquo;s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nDust of Sneezing and Choking # Wondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.\nDwarven Plate # Armor (plate), very rare\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.\nDwarven Thrower # Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.\n"},{"id":752,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-e/","title":"Magic Items E","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (E) # Efficient Quiver # Wondrous item, uncommon\nEach of the quiver\u0026rsquo;s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.\nYou can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\nEfreeti Bottle # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\nThe first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nTable- Efreeti Bottle\nd100 Effect 01-10 The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. 11-90 The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can\u0026rsquo;t be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. 91-100 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. Elemental Gem # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell, and the gem\u0026rsquo;s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nTable- Elemental Gem\nGem Summoned Elemental Blue sapphire Air elemental Yellow diamond Earth elemental Red corundum Fire elemental Emerald Water elemental Elven Chain # Armor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\nEversmoking Bottle # Wondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud\u0026rsquo;s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\nEyes of Charming # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.\nEyes of Minute Seeing # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes.

You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.\nEyes of the Eagle # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can\u0026rsquo;t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\nBird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can\u0026rsquo;t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\nFan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.\nSwan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot long, 20-foot wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.\nTree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\nWhip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6+5 force damage.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.\nFigurine of Wondrous Power # Wondrous item, rarity by figurine\nA figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u0026rsquo;t become a creature.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u0026rsquo;s description.\nBronze Griffon (Rare).

Once a lion has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nIvory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\nThe goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 30 days have passed. The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\u0026rsquo;t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat\u0026rsquo;s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 15 days have passed. Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long.

The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.\nFolding Boat # Wondrous item, rare\nThis object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside.

The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.\nThe second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.\nWhen the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.\nThe third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard.

While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\nThe first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn\u0026rsquo;t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem. The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it.

The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.\nGloves of Missile Snaring # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you\u0026rsquo;re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10+your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.\nGloves of Swimming and Climbing # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don\u0026rsquo;t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.\nGoggles of Night # Wondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

You must be wearing a belt of giant strength (any variety) and gauntlets of ogre power to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.\nThe hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet.

The hammer regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.\nHandy Haversack # Wondrous item, rare\nThis backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can\u0026rsquo;t be reopened.\nHat of Disguise # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will.

It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher.\nHelm of Brilliance # Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals.

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm. As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage. As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon. Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.\nHelm of Comprehending Languages # Wondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the comprehend languages spell from it at will.\nHelm of Telepathy # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it.

It can reply-using a bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.\nWhile focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature.

Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.\nEach use of the horn\u0026rsquo;s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\nHorn of Valhalla # Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)\nYou can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nFour types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn\u0026rsquo;s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn\u0026rsquo;s type or determines it randomly.\nTable- Horn of Valhalla\nd100 Horn Type Berserkers Summoned Requirement 01-40 Silver 2d4+2 None 41-75 Brass 3d4+3 Proficiency with all simple weapons 76-90 Bronze 4d4+4 Proficiency with all medium armor 91-00 Iron 5d4+5 Proficiency with all martial weapons If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\nHorseshoes of Speed # Wondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature\u0026rsquo;s walking speed by 30 feet.\n"},{"id":756,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-i/","title":"Magic Items I","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (I) # Immovable Rod # Rod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn\u0026rsquo;t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\nInstant Fortress # Wondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\nThe tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,\nimmunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\nIoun Stone # Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nAn Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.\nWhen you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.\nA stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can\u0026rsquo;t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\nAwareness (Rare). You can\u0026rsquo;t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nFortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\nGreater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can\u0026rsquo;t cancel it.\nInsight (Very Rare).

You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can\u0026rsquo;t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare). You don\u0026rsquo;t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\nIron Bands of Binding # Wondrous item, rare\nThis rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.\nMake a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.\nA creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.\nOnce the bands are used, they can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nIron Flask # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask\u0026rsquo;s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you\u0026rsquo;re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn\u0026rsquo;t age.\nYou can use an action to remove the flask\u0026rsquo;s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.\nAn identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nTable- Iron Flask\nd100 Contents 1‒50 Empty 51‒54 Demon (type 1) 55‒58 Demon (type 2) 59‒62 Demon (type 3) 63‒64 Demon (type 4) 65 Demon (type 5) 66 Demon (type 6) 67 Deva 68‒69 Devil (greater) 70‒73 Devil (lesser) 74‒75 Djinni 76‒77 Efreeti 78‒83 Elemental (any) 84‒86 Invisible stalker 87‒90 Night hag 91 Planetar 92‒95 Salamander 96 Solar 97‒99 Succubus/incubus 100 Xorn "},{"id":757,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-j/","title":"Magic Items J","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (J) # Javelin of Lightning # Weapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMantle of Spell Resistance # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.\nManual of Bodily Health # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book\u0026rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nManual of Gainful Exercise # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book\u0026rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nManual of Golems # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can\u0026rsquo;t use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\nTable- Manual of Golems\nd20 Golem Time Cost 1-5 Clay 30 days 65,000 gp 6-17 Flesh 60 days 50,000 gp 18 Iron 120 days 100,000 gp 19-20 Stone 90 days 80,000 gp To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.\nOnce you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.\nManual of Quickness of Action # Wondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book\u0026rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nMarvelous Pigments # Wondrous item, very rare\nTypically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons - that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\nMedallion of Thoughts # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMirror of Life Trapping # Wondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror\u0026rsquo;s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror\u0026rsquo;s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror\u0026rsquo;s cells don\u0026rsquo;t age, and they don\u0026rsquo;t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror\u0026rsquo;s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\nMithral Armor # Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon\nMithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\n"},{"id":761,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-n/","title":"Magic Items N","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (N) # Necklace of Adaptation # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\nNecklace of Fireballs # Wondrous item, rare\nThis necklace has 1d6+3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\nNecklace of Prayer Beads # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)\nThis necklace has 1d4+2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.\nSix types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary).

If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune).

You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range.

The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it\u0026rsquo;s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes.

Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.\nAlternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\n"},{"id":763,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-p/","title":"Magic Items P","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (P) # Pearl of Power # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)\nWhile this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot.

If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion\u0026rsquo;s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\nPipes of Haunting # Wondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren\u0026rsquo;t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nPipes of the Sewers # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren\u0026rsquo;t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nWhenever a swarm of rats that isn\u0026rsquo;t under another creature\u0026rsquo;s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm\u0026rsquo;s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by the pipes\u0026rsquo; music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes\u0026rsquo; music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can\u0026rsquo;t hear the pipes\u0026rsquo; music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by the pipes\u0026rsquo; music for the next 24 hours.\nPlate Armor of Etherealness # Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile you\u0026rsquo;re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nPortable Hole # Wondrous item, rare\nThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can\u0026rsquo;t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\nYou can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what\u0026rsquo;s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole\u0026rsquo;s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can\u0026rsquo;t be reopened.\nPotion of Animal Friendship # Potion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will.

Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\nPotion of Flying # Potion, very rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft.

This potion\u0026rsquo;s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.\nPotion of Giant Strength # Potion, rarity varies\nWhen you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.\nThis potion\u0026rsquo;s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.\nTable- Potion of Giant Strength\nType of Giant Strength Rarity Hill giant 21 Uncommon Frost/stone giant 23 Rare Fire giant 25 Rare Cloud giant 27 Very rare Storm giant 29 Legendary Potion of Growth # Potion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the \u0026ldquo;enlarge\u0026rdquo; effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion\u0026rsquo;s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\nPotion of Healing # Potion, rarity varies\nYou regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion\u0026rsquo;s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion\u0026rsquo;s red liquid glimmers when agitated.\nTable- Potions of Healing\nPotion of \u0026hellip; Rarity HP Regained Healing Common 2d4+2 Greater healing Uncommon 4d4+4 Superior healing Rare 8d4+8 Supreme healing Very rare 10d4+20 Potion of Heroism # Potion, rare\nFor 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.

The potion\u0026rsquo;s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.\nPotion of Poison # Potion, uncommon\nThis concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.\nIf you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6.

Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.\nTable- Ring of Shooting Stars\nSpheres Lightning Damage 4 2d4 3 2d6 2 5d4 1 4d12 Shooting Stars. You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.

The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can\u0026rsquo;t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nRing of Spell Turning # Ring, legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.\nRing of Swimming # Ring, uncommon\nYou have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing this ring.\nRing of Telekinesis # Ring, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you can cast the telekinesis spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried.\nRing of the Ram # Ring, rare (requires attunement)\nThis ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.\nAlternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring\u0026rsquo;s charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn\u0026rsquo;t being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.\nRing of Three Wishes # Ring, legendary\nWhile wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the wish spell from it.

When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don\u0026rsquo;t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\nWhenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.\nRobe of Eyes # Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis robe is adorned with eyelike patterns.

The eyes on the robe can\u0026rsquo;t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.\nA light spell cast on the robe or a daylight spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for light or DC 15 for daylight), ending the blindness on a success.\nRobe of Scintillating Colors # Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn.

Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.\nWhile you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying.

You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.\nRobe of the Archmagi # Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)\nThis elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe\u0026rsquo;s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can\u0026rsquo;t attune to a robe of the archmagi that doesn\u0026rsquo;t correspond to your alignment.\nYou gain these benefits while wearing the robe:\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15+your Dexterity modifier. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2. Robe of Useful Items # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.\nThe robe has two of each of the following patches:\nDagger Bullseye lantern (filled and lit) Steel mirror 10-foot pole Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled) Sack In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM chooses the patches or determines them randomly.\nTable- Robe of Useful Items\nd100 Patch 01-08 Bag of 100 gp 09-15 Silver coffer (1 foot long, 6 inches wide and deep) worth 500 gp 16-22 Iron door (up to 10 feet wide and 10 feet high, barred on one side of your choice), which you can place in an opening you can reach; it conforms to fit the opening, attaching and hinging itself 23-30 10 gems worth 100 gp each 31-44 Wooden ladder (24 feet long) 45-51 A riding horse with saddle bags 52-59 Pit (a cube 10 feet on a side), which you can place on the ground within 10 feet of you 60-68 4 potions of healing 69-75 Rowboat (12 feet long) 76-83 Spell scroll containing one spell of 1st to 3rd level 84-90 2 mastiffs 91-96 Window (2 feet by 4 feet, up to 2 feet deep), which you can place on a vertical surface you can reach 97-100 Portable ram Rod of Absorption # Rod, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell\u0026rsquo;s effect is canceled, and the spell\u0026rsquo;s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can\u0026rsquo;t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can\u0026rsquo;t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\nRod of Alertness # Rod, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod\u0026rsquo;s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.\nThe rod\u0026rsquo;s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Lordly Might # Rod, legendary (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod\u0026rsquo;s six buttons as a bonus action. A button\u0026rsquo;s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod\u0026rsquo;s flanged head (you choose the type of sword).\nIf you press button 2, the rod\u0026rsquo;s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 3, the rod\u0026rsquo;s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod\u0026rsquo;s tip, and the rod\u0026rsquo;s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Rulership # Rod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Security # Rod, very rare\nWhile holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.\nFor each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don\u0026rsquo;t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).\nWhen the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until ten days have passed.\nRope of Climbing # Wondrous item, uncommon\nThis 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.\nIf you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\nRope of Entanglement # Wondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target\u0026rsquo;s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n"},{"id":766,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-s/","title":"Magic Items S","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (S) # Scarab of Protection # Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells. The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you.

You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\nSovereign Glue # Wondrous item, legendary\nThis viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6+1 ounces.\nOne ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\nSpell Scroll # Scroll, varies\nA spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class\u0026rsquo;s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell\u0026rsquo;s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.\nIf the spell is on your class\u0026rsquo;s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10+the spell\u0026rsquo;s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell\u0026rsquo;s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll\u0026rsquo;s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\nTable- Spell Scroll\nSpell Level Rarity Save DC Attack Bonus Cantrip Common 13 +5 1st Common 13 +5 2nd Uncommon 13 +5 3rd Uncommon 15 +7 4th Rare 15 +7 5th Rare 17 +9 6th Very rare 17 +9 7th Very rare 18 +10 8th Very rare 18 +10 9th Legendary 19 +11 A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied.

Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn\u0026rsquo;t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.\nIf you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature\u0026rsquo;s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature\u0026rsquo;s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.\nIf the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\nTable- Sphere of Annihilation\nd100 Result 01-50 The sphere is destroyed. 51-85 The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. 86-00 A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.

If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12+1 charges.\nSpell Absorption. While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell\u0026rsquo;s level. However, if doing so brings the staff\u0026rsquo;s total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).\nSpells. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: conjure elemental (7 charges), dispel magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), flaming sphere (2 charges), ice storm (4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), lightning bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges), passwall (5 charges), plane shift (7 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges).\nYou can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: arcane lock, detect magic, enlarge/reduce, light, mage hand, or protection from evil and good.\nRetributive Strike. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot radius sphere centered on it.\nYou have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\nTable- Staff of the Magi\nDistance from Origin Damage 10 ft. away or closer 8 × the number of charges in the staff 11 to 20 ft. away 6 × the number of charges in the staff 21 to 30 ft. away 4 × the number of charges in the staff Staff of the Python # Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)\nYou can use an action to speak this staff\u0026rsquo;s command word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor snake under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.\nOn your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren\u0026rsquo;t incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.\nIf the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.\nStaff of the Woodlands # Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid)\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.\nSpells. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff\u0026rsquo;s charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: animal friendship (1 charge), awaken (5 charges), barkskin (2 charges), locate animals or plants (2 charges), speak with animals (1 charge), speak with plants (3 charges), or wall of thorns (6 charges).\nYou can also use an action to cast the pass without trace spell from the staff without using any charges.\nTree Form. You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\nThe tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic.

You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff\u0026rsquo;s tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long.

You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn\u0026rsquo;t deafened.\nThunder and Lightning. You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn\u0026rsquo;t expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.\nStaff of Withering # Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)\nThis staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nThe staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff.

When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.\nThe sword\u0026rsquo;s luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.\nSword of Life Stealing # Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, provided that the target isn\u0026rsquo;t a construct or an undead.

Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.\nSword of Wounding # Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)\nHit points lost to this weapon\u0026rsquo;s damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.\nOnce per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature\u0026rsquo;s turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you\u0026rsquo;ve wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.\n"},{"id":767,"href":"/references/treasure-alt/magic-items-t/","title":"Magic Items T","section":"References","content":" Magic Items (T) # Talisman of Pure Good # Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)\nThis talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness.

The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u0026rsquo;t be used again until 30 days have passed. The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\u0026rsquo;t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons.

When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can\u0026rsquo;t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare).

No matter what\u0026rsquo;s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole\u0026rsquo;s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.
