<a class=anchor href=#amulet-of-health>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet.

<a class=anchor href=#amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can&rsquo;t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p><h3 id=amulet-of-the-planes>Amulet of the Planes
<a class=anchor href=#amulet-of-the-planes>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the <em>plane shift</em> spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.</p><h3 id=animated-shield>Animated Shield
<a class=anchor href=#animated-shield>#</a></h3><p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.</p><h3 id=apparatus-of-the-crab>Apparatus of the Crab
<a class=anchor href=#apparatus-of-the-crab>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p><p>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</p><p>The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:</p><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 20</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 200</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren&rsquo;t extended)</p><p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic</p><p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus&rsquo;s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p><p>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p><p>A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus&rsquo;s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p><p><strong>Table- Apparatus of the Crab</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Lever</th><th>Up</th><th>Down</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim.</td><td>Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus&rsquo;s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Forward window shutter opens.</td><td>Forward window shutter closes.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Side window shutters open (two per side).</td><td>Side window shutters close (two per side).</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.</td><td>The claws retract.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

<a class=anchor href=#arrow-of-slaying>#</a></h3><p><em>Weapon (arrow), very rare</em></p><p>An <em>arrow of slaying</em> is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both <em>arrows of dragon slaying</em> and <em>arrows of blue dragon slaying</em>. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an <em>arrow of slaying</em> takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</p><p>Once an <em>arrow of slaying</em> deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.</p><p>Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as <em>bolts of slaying</em> meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#adamantine-armor>Adamantine Armor</a></li><li><a href=#ammunition-1-2-or-3>Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3</a></li><li><a href=#amulet-of-health>Amulet of Health</a></li><li><a href=#amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location>Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location</a></li><li><a href=#amulet-of-the-planes>Amulet of the Planes</a></li><li><a href=#animated-shield>Animated Shield</a></li><li><a href=#apparatus-of-the-crab>Apparatus of the Crab</a></li><li><a href=#armor-1-2-or-3>Armor, +1, +2, or +3</a></li><li><a href=#armor-of-invulnerability>Armor of Invulnerability</a></li><li><a href=#armor-of-resistance>Armor of Resistance</a></li><li><a href=#armor-of-vulnerability>Armor of Vulnerability</a></li><li><a href=#arrow-catching-shield>Arrow-Catching Shield</a></li><li><a href=#arrow-of-slaying>Arrow of Slaying</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
