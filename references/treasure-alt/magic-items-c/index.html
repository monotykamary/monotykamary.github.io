After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle&rsquo;s total burn time.</p><p>While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle&rsquo;s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell&rsquo;s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.</p><p>Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the <em>gate</em> spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.</p><h3 id=cape-of-the-mountebank>Cape of the Mountebank
<a class=anchor href=#cape-of-the-mountebank>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the <em>dimension door</em> spell as an action. This property of the cape can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p>When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.</p><h3 id=carpet-of-flying>Carpet of Flying
<a class=anchor href=#carpet-of-flying>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>You can speak the carpet&rsquo;s command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.</p><p>Four sizes of <em>carpet of flying</em> exist. The GM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.</p><p><strong>Table- Carpet of Flying</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Size</th><th>Capacity</th><th>Flying Speed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01-20</td><td>3 ft. × 5 ft.</td><td>200 lb.</td><td>80 feet</td></tr><tr><td>21-55</td><td>4 ft. × 6 ft.</td><td>400 lb.</td><td>60 feet</td></tr><tr><td>56-80</td><td>5 ft. × 7 ft.</td><td>600 lb.</td><td>40 feet</td></tr><tr><td>81-100</td><td>6 ft. × 9 ft.</td><td>800 lb.</td><td>30 feet</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.</p><h3 id=censer-of-controlling-air-elementals>Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
<a class=anchor href=#censer-of-controlling-air-elementals>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak the censer&rsquo;s command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had cast the <em>conjure elemental</em> spell. The censer can&rsquo;t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><p>This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.</p><h3 id=chime-of-opening>Chime of Opening
<a class=anchor href=#chime-of-opening>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can&rsquo;t reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.</p><p>The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.</p><h3 id=circlet-of-blasting>Circlet of Blasting
<a class=anchor href=#circlet-of-blasting>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the <em>scorching ray</em> spell with it.

<a class=anchor href=#cloak-of-displacement>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.</p><h3 id=cloak-of-elvenkind>Cloak of Elvenkind
<a class=anchor href=#cloak-of-elvenkind>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak&rsquo;s color shifts to camouflage you.

In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak&rsquo;s edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.</p><p>While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast <em>polymorph</em> on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can&rsquo;t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><h3 id=cloak-of-the-manta-ray>Cloak of the Manta Ray
<a class=anchor href=#cloak-of-the-manta-ray>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 60 feet. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.</p><h3 id=crystal-ball>Crystal Ball
<a class=anchor href=#crystal-ball>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)</em></p><p>The typical <em>crystal ball</em>, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the <em>scrying</em> spell (save DC 17) with it.</p><p>The following <em>crystal ball</em> variants are legendary items and have additional properties.</p><p><em><strong>Crystal Ball of Mind Reading</strong></em>. You can use an action to cast the <em>detect thoughts</em> spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the <em>crystal ball</em>, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell&rsquo;s sensor.

While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell&rsquo;s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the <em>suggestion</em> spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don&rsquo;t need to concentrate on this <em>suggestion</em> to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if <em>scrying</em> ends. Once used, the <em>suggestion</em> power of the <em>crystal ball</em> can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Crystal Ball of True Seeing</strong></em>.

Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube&rsquo;s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier&rsquo;s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.</p><p>If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can&rsquo;t pass through the cube, you can&rsquo;t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.</p><p><strong>Table- Cube of Force Effects</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Face</th><th>Charges</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Gases, wind, and fog can&rsquo;t pass through the barrier.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>Nonliving matter can&rsquo;t pass through the barrier.
