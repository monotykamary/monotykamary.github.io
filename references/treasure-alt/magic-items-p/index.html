<a class=anchor href=#magic-items-p>#</a></h1><h3 id=pearl-of-power>Pearl of Power
<a class=anchor href=#pearl-of-power>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em></p><p>While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><h3 id=periapt-of-health>Periapt of Health
<a class=anchor href=#periapt-of-health>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.</p><h3 id=periapt-of-proof-against-poison>Periapt of Proof against Poison
<a class=anchor href=#periapt-of-proof-against-poison>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage.</p><h3 id=periapt-of-wound-closure>Periapt of Wound Closure
<a class=anchor href=#periapt-of-wound-closure>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.</p><h3 id=philter-of-love>Philter of Love
<a class=anchor href=#philter-of-love>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion&rsquo;s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.</p><h3 id=pipes-of-haunting>Pipes of Haunting
<a class=anchor href=#pipes-of-haunting>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren&rsquo;t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><h3 id=pipes-of-the-sewers>Pipes of the Sewers
<a class=anchor href=#pipes-of-the-sewers>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.</p><p>The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren&rsquo;t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren&rsquo;t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p>Whenever a swarm of rats that isn&rsquo;t under another creature&rsquo;s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm&rsquo;s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can&rsquo;t be swayed by the pipes&rsquo; music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes&rsquo; music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can&rsquo;t hear the pipes&rsquo; music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can&rsquo;t be swayed by the pipes&rsquo; music for the next 24 hours.</p><h3 id=plate-armor-of-etherealness>Plate Armor of Etherealness
<a class=anchor href=#plate-armor-of-etherealness>#</a></h3><p><em>Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While you&rsquo;re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the <em>etherealness</em> spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><h3 id=portable-hole>Portable Hole
<a class=anchor href=#portable-hole>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p><p>You can use an action to unfold a <em>portable hole</em> and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the <em>portable hole</em> creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can&rsquo;t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open <em>portable hole</em> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</p><p>You can use an action to close a <em>portable hole</em> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what&rsquo;s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p><p>If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole&rsquo;s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the <em>portable hole</em> or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed <em>portable hole</em> can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p><p>Placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>bag of holding</em>, <em>handy haversack</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can&rsquo;t be reopened.</p><h3 id=potion-of-animal-friendship>Potion of Animal Friendship
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-animal-friendship>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you can cast the <em>animal friendship</em> spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.</p><h3 id=potion-of-clairvoyance>Potion of Clairvoyance
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-clairvoyance>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the <em>clairvoyance</em> spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.</p><h3 id=potion-of-climbing>Potion of Climbing
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-climbing>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, common</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.</p><h3 id=potion-of-diminution>Potion of Diminution
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-diminution>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain the &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; effect of the <em>enlarge/reduce</em> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion&rsquo;s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p><h3 id=potion-of-flying>Potion of Flying
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-flying>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, very rare</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you&rsquo;re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion&rsquo;s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.</p><h3 id=potion-of-gaseous-form>Potion of Gaseous Form
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-gaseous-form>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the <em>gaseous form</em> spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion&rsquo;s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.</p><h3 id=potion-of-giant-strength>Potion of Giant Strength
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-giant-strength>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, rarity varies</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.</p><p>This potion&rsquo;s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The <em>potion of frost giant strength</em> and the <em>potion of stone giant strength</em> have the same effect.</p><p><strong>Table- Potion of Giant Strength</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Type of Giant</th><th>Strength</th><th>Rarity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hill giant</td><td>21</td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><td>Frost/stone giant</td><td>23</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><td>Fire giant</td><td>25</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><td>Cloud giant</td><td>27</td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><td>Storm giant</td><td>29</td><td>Legendary</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=potion-of-growth>Potion of Growth
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-growth>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain the &ldquo;enlarge&rdquo; effect of the <em>enlarge/reduce</em> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion&rsquo;s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p><h3 id=potion-of-healing>Potion of Healing
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-healing>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, rarity varies</em></p><p>You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion&rsquo;s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion&rsquo;s red liquid glimmers when agitated.</p><p><strong>Table- Potions of Healing</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Potion of &mldr;</th><th>Rarity</th><th>HP Regained</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Healing</td><td>Common</td><td>2d4+2</td></tr><tr><td>Greater healing</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>4d4+4</td></tr><tr><td>Superior healing</td><td>Rare</td><td>8d4+8</td></tr><tr><td>Supreme healing</td><td>Very rare</td><td>10d4+20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=potion-of-heroism>Potion of Heroism
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-heroism>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the <em>bless</em> spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.</p><h3 id=potion-of-invisibility>Potion of Invisibility
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-invisibility>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, very rare</em></p><p>This potion&rsquo;s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.</p><h3 id=potion-of-mind-reading>Potion of Mind Reading

The potion&rsquo;s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.</p><h3 id=potion-of-poison>Potion of Poison
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-poison>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a <em>potion of healing</em> or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An <em>identify</em> spell reveals its true nature.</p><p>If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.</p><h3 id=potion-of-resistance>Potion of Resistance
<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-resistance>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour.

<a class=anchor href=#potion-of-water-breathing>#</a></h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>You can breathe underwater for 1 hour after drinking this potion.
