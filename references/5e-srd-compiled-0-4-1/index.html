<a class=anchor href=#dd-5e-srd-full-compile-v041>#</a></h1><h1 id=races>Races
<a class=anchor href=#races>#</a></h1><h2 id=racial-traits>Racial Traits
<a class=anchor href=#racial-traits>#</a></h2><p>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.</p><h3 id=ability-score-increase>Ability Score Increase
<a class=anchor href=#ability-score-increase>#</a></h3><p>Every race increases one or more of a character&rsquo;s ability scores.</p><h3 id=age>Age
<a class=anchor href=#age>#</a></h3><p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race&rsquo;s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p><h3 id=alignment>Alignment
<a class=anchor href=#alignment>#</a></h3><p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.</p><h3 id=size>Size
<a class=anchor href=#size>#</a></h3><p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in &ldquo;Equipment.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=speed>Speed
<a class=anchor href=#speed>#</a></h3><p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (&ldquo;Adventuring&rdquo;) and fighting (&ldquo;Combat&rdquo;).</p><h3 id=languages>Languages
<a class=anchor href=#languages>#</a></h3><p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.</p><h3 id=subraces>Subraces
<a class=anchor href=#subraces>#</a></h3><p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.</p><h1 id=dwarf>Dwarf
<a class=anchor href=#dwarf>#</a></h1><h3 id=dwarf-traits>Dwarf Traits
<a class=anchor href=#dwarf-traits>#</a></h3><p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they&rsquo;re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong></em>. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Dwarven Resilience</strong></em>. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Dwarven Combat Training</strong></em>. You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.</p><p><em><strong>Tool Proficiency</strong></em>. You gain proficiency with the artisan&rsquo;s tools of your choice: smith&rsquo;s tools, brewer&rsquo;s supplies, or mason&rsquo;s tools.</p><p><em><strong>Stonecunning</strong></em>. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.</p><h2 id=hill-dwarf>Hill Dwarf
<a class=anchor href=#hill-dwarf>#</a></h2><p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Dwarven Toughness</strong></em>. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p><h1 id=elf>Elf
<a class=anchor href=#elf>#</a></h1><h3 id=elf-traits>Elf Traits
<a class=anchor href=#elf-traits>#</a></h3><p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others&rsquo; freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong></em>. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Keen Senses</strong></em>. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p><p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong></em>. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Trance</strong></em>. Elves don&rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.</p><p>After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar.

The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).</p><p><strong>Table- Life Domain Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>bless, cure wounds</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>lesser restoration, spiritual weapon</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>beacon of hope, revivify</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>death ward, guardian of faith</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>mass cure wounds, raise dead</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=bonus-proficiency>Bonus Proficiency

<a class=anchor href=#disciple-of-life>#</a></h4><p>Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell&rsquo;s level.</p><h4 id=channel-divinity-preserve-life>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
<a class=anchor href=#channel-divinity-preserve-life>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.</p><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can&rsquo;t use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p><h4 id=blessed-healer>Blessed Healer
<a class=anchor href=#blessed-healer>#</a></h4><p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell&rsquo;s level.</p><h4 id=divine-strike>Divine Strike
<a class=anchor href=#divine-strike>#</a></h4><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h4 id=supreme-healing>Supreme Healing
<a class=anchor href=#supreme-healing>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</p><h1 id=druid>Druid

<a class=anchor href=#druidic>#</a></h3><p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message&rsquo;s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can&rsquo;t decipher it without magic.</p><h3 id=spellcasting-2>Spellcasting
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-2>#</a></h3><p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.</p><h4 id=cantrips-2>Cantrips
<a class=anchor href=#cantrips-2>#</a></h4><p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p><h4 id=preparing-and-casting-spells-1>Preparing and Casting Spells
<a class=anchor href=#preparing-and-casting-spells-1>#</a></h4><p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>cure wounds</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h3 id=spellcasting-ability-2>Spellcasting Ability
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-ability-2>#</a></h3><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h3 id=ritual-casting-2>Ritual Casting
<a class=anchor href=#ritual-casting-2>#</a></h3><p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h4 id=spellcasting-focus-2>Spellcasting Focus
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-focus-2>#</a></h4><p>You can use a druidic focus (see chapter ##, &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p><h3 id=wild-shape>Wild Shape
<a class=anchor href=#wild-shape>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&rsquo;t have a flying or swimming speed.</p><p><strong>Table- Beast Shapes</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Max. CR</th><th>Limitations</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>1/4</td><td>No flying or swimming speed</td><td>Wolf</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>1/2</td><td>No flying speed</td><td>Crocodile</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>Giant eagle</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p><p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p><ul><li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&rsquo;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&rsquo;t use them.</li><li>When you transform, you assume the beast&rsquo;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&rsquo;t knocked unconscious.</li><li>You can&rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&rsquo;ve already cast.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li></ul><h3 id=druid-circle>Druid Circle
<a class=anchor href=#druid-circle>#</a></h3><p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3 id=ability-score-improvement-3>Ability Score Improvement
<a class=anchor href=#ability-score-improvement-3>#</a></h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3 id=timeless-body>Timeless Body
<a class=anchor href=#timeless-body>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p><h3 id=beast-spells>Beast Spells
<a class=anchor href=#beast-spells>#</a></h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren&rsquo;t able to provide material components.</p><h3 id=archdruid>Archdruid
<a class=anchor href=#archdruid>#</a></h3><p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p><p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren&rsquo;t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p><h2 id=druid-circles>Druid Circles
<a class=anchor href=#druid-circles>#</a></h2><h3 id=circle-of-the-land>Circle of the Land
<a class=anchor href=#circle-of-the-land>#</a></h3><p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle&rsquo;s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle&rsquo;s mysterious rites.</p><h4 id=bonus-cantrip>Bonus Cantrip
<a class=anchor href=#bonus-cantrip>#</a></h4><p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p><h4 id=natural-recovery>Natural Recovery
<a class=anchor href=#natural-recovery>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p><h4 id=circle-spells>Circle Spells
<a class=anchor href=#circle-spells>#</a></h4><p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells.</p><p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p><p><strong>Table- Arctic Circle Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>hold person, spike growth</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>sleet storm, slow</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>freedom of movement, ice storm</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>commune with nature, cone of cold</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Coast Circle Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>mirror image, misty step</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>water breathing, water walk</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>control water, freedom of movement</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>conjure elemental, scrying</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Desert Circle Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>blur, silence</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>create food and water, protection from energy</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>blight, hallucinatory terrain</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>insect plague, wall of stone</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Forest Circle Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>barkskin, spider climb</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>call lightning, plant growth</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>divination, freedom of movement</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>commune with nature, tree stride</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Grassland Circle Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>invisibility, pass without trace</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>daylight, haste</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>divination, freedom of movement</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>dream, insect plague</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Mountain Circle Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>spider climb, spike growth</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>lightning bolt, meld into stone</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>stone shape, stoneskin</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>passwall, wall of stone</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Swamp Circle Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>acid arrow, darkness</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>water walk, stinking cloud</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>freedom of movement, locate creature</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>insect plague, scrying</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=lands-stride>Land&rsquo;s Stride
<a class=anchor href=#lands-stride>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <em>entangle</em> spell.</p><h4 id=natures-ward>Nature&rsquo;s Ward
<a class=anchor href=#natures-ward>#</a></h4><p>When you reach 10th level, you can&rsquo;t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p><h4 id=natures-sanctuary>Nature&rsquo;s Sanctuary
<a class=anchor href=#natures-sanctuary>#</a></h4><p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sacred Plants and Wood</strong></p><p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><p><strong>Druids and the Gods</strong></p><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p></blockquote><h1 id=fighter>Fighter

<a class=anchor href=#monastic-traditions>#</a></h2><p>Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest.

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p><p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time.

<a class=anchor href=#divine-smite>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon&rsquo;s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p><h3 id=divine-health>Divine Health
<a class=anchor href=#divine-health>#</a></h3><p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p><h3 id=sacred-oath>Sacred Oath
<a class=anchor href=#sacred-oath>#</a></h3><p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p><h4 id=oath-spells>Oath Spells
<a class=anchor href=#oath-spells>#</a></h4><p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p><h4 id=channel-divinity-1>Channel Divinity
<a class=anchor href=#channel-divinity-1>#</a></h4><p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p><h3 id=ability-score-improvement-6>Ability Score Improvement
<a class=anchor href=#ability-score-improvement-6>#</a></h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3 id=extra-attack-3>Extra Attack
<a class=anchor href=#extra-attack-3>#</a></h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h3 id=aura-of-protection>Aura of Protection
<a class=anchor href=#aura-of-protection>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3 id=aura-of-courage>Aura of Courage
<a class=anchor href=#aura-of-courage>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can&rsquo;t be frightened while you are conscious.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3 id=improved-divine-smite>Improved Divine Smite
<a class=anchor href=#improved-divine-smite>#</a></h3><p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.</p><h3 id=cleansing-touch>Cleansing Touch
<a class=anchor href=#cleansing-touch>#</a></h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2 id=sacred-oaths>Sacred Oaths
<a class=anchor href=#sacred-oaths>#</a></h2><p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin&rsquo;s training. Some characters with this class don&rsquo;t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin&rsquo;s heart.</p><h3 id=oath-of-devotion>Oath of Devotion
<a class=anchor href=#oath-of-devotion>#</a></h3><p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&rsquo; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p><h4 id=tenets-of-devotion>Tenets of Devotion
<a class=anchor href=#tenets-of-devotion>#</a></h4><p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p><p><em><strong>Honesty</strong></em>. Don&rsquo;t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</p><p><em><strong>Courage</strong></em>. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p><p><em><strong>Compassion</strong></em>. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</p><p><em><strong>Honor</strong></em>. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</p><p><em><strong>Duty</strong></em>. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</p><h4 id=oath-spells-1>Oath Spells
<a class=anchor href=#oath-spells-1>#</a></h4><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><p><strong>Table- Oath of Devotion Spells</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Paladin Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>protection from evil and good, sanctuary</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>lesser restoration, zone of truth</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>beacon of hope, dispel magic</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>freedom of movement, guardian of faith</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>commune, flame strike</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=channel-divinity-2>Channel Divinity
<a class=anchor href=#channel-divinity-2>#</a></h4><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><em><strong>Sacred Weapon</strong></em>. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p><p>You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p><p><em><strong>Turn the Unholy</strong></em>. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><h4 id=aura-of-devotion>Aura of Devotion
<a class=anchor href=#aura-of-devotion>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can&rsquo;t be charmed while you are conscious.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h5 id=purity-of-spirit>Purity of Spirit
<a class=anchor href=#purity-of-spirit>#</a></h5><p>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a <em>protection from evil and good</em> spell.</p><h4 id=holy-nimbus>Holy Nimbus
<a class=anchor href=#holy-nimbus>#</a></h4><p>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.</p><p>Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.</p><p>In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Breaking Your Oath</strong></p><p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p><p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p><p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p></blockquote><h1 id=ranger>Ranger

<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-ability-4>#</a></h4><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature.

In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h3 id=ranger-archetype>Ranger Archetype

<a class=anchor href=#lands-stride-1>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <em>entangle</em> spell.</p><h3 id=hide-in-plain-sight>Hide in Plain Sight

<a class=anchor href=#feral-senses>#</a></h3><p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can&rsquo;t see. When you attack a creature you can&rsquo;t see, your inability to see it doesn&rsquo;t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p><p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn&rsquo;t hidden from you and you aren&rsquo;t blinded or deafened.</p><h3 id=foe-slayer>Foe Slayer

You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p><h2 id=ranger-archetypes>Ranger Archetypes
<a class=anchor href=#ranger-archetypes>#</a></h2><p>The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.</p><h3 id=hunter>Hunter
<a class=anchor href=#hunter>#</a></h3><p>Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness.

<a class=anchor href=#expertise-1>#</a></h3><p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves&rsquo; tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves&rsquo; tools) to gain this benefit.</p><h3 id=sneak-attack>Sneak Attack
<a class=anchor href=#sneak-attack>#</a></h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe&rsquo;s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn&rsquo;t incapacitated, and you don&rsquo;t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p><p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p><h3 id=thieves-cant>Thieves&rsquo; Cant
<a class=anchor href=#thieves-cant>#</a></h3><p>During your rogue training you learned thieves&rsquo; cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves&rsquo; cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves&rsquo; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p><h3 id=cunning-action>Cunning Action
<a class=anchor href=#cunning-action>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p><h3 id=roguish-archetype>Roguish Archetype
<a class=anchor href=#roguish-archetype>#</a></h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p><h3 id=ability-score-improvement-8>Ability Score Improvement
<a class=anchor href=#ability-score-improvement-8>#</a></h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3 id=uncanny-dodge>Uncanny Dodge
<a class=anchor href=#uncanny-dodge>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack&rsquo;s damage against you.</p><h3 id=evasion-1>Evasion
<a class=anchor href=#evasion-1>#</a></h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon&rsquo;s fiery breath or an <em>ice storm</em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3 id=reliable-talent>Reliable Talent
<a class=anchor href=#reliable-talent>#</a></h3><p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p><h3 id=blindsense>Blindsense
<a class=anchor href=#blindsense>#</a></h3><p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p><h3 id=slippery-mind>Slippery Mind
<a class=anchor href=#slippery-mind>#</a></h3><p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p><h3 id=elusive>Elusive
<a class=anchor href=#elusive>#</a></h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren&rsquo;t incapacitated.</p><h3 id=stroke-of-luck>Stroke of Luck
<a class=anchor href=#stroke-of-luck>#</a></h3><p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2 id=roguish-archetypes>Roguish Archetypes
<a class=anchor href=#roguish-archetypes>#</a></h2><p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p><h3 id=thief>Thief
<a class=anchor href=#thief>#</a></h3><p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn&rsquo;t employ.</p><h4 id=fast-hands>Fast Hands
<a class=anchor href=#fast-hands>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves&rsquo; tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</p><h4 id=second-story-work>Second-Story Work
<a class=anchor href=#second-story-work>#</a></h4><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p><p>In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p><h4 id=supreme-sneak>Supreme Sneak
<a class=anchor href=#supreme-sneak>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p><h4 id=use-magic-device>Use Magic Device
<a class=anchor href=#use-magic-device>#</a></h4><p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p><h4 id=thiefs-reflexes>Thief&rsquo;s Reflexes
<a class=anchor href=#thiefs-reflexes>#</a></h4><p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger.

<a class=anchor href=#sorcerous-origins>#</a></h2><p>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.</p><h3 id=draconic-bloodline>Draconic Bloodline
<a class=anchor href=#draconic-bloodline>#</a></h3><p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</p><h4 id=dragon-ancestor>Dragon Ancestor
<a class=anchor href=#dragon-ancestor>#</a></h4><p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor.

At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p><p>Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p><h4 id=elemental-affinity>Elemental Affinity
<a class=anchor href=#elemental-affinity>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.</p><h4 id=dragon-wings>Dragon Wings
<a class=anchor href=#dragon-wings>#</a></h4><p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.</p><h4 id=draconic-presence>Draconic Presence
<a class=anchor href=#draconic-presence>#</a></h4><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p><h1 id=warlock>Warlock

<a class=anchor href=#otherworldly-patron>#</a></h3><p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3 id=pact-magic>Pact Magic
<a class=anchor href=#pact-magic>#</a></h3><p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.</p><h4 id=cantrips-4>Cantrips
<a class=anchor href=#cantrips-4>#</a></h4><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p><h4 id=spell-slots-3>Spell Slots
<a class=anchor href=#spell-slots-3>#</a></h4><p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <em>witch bolt</em>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p><h4 id=spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher-3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
<a class=anchor href=#spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher-3>#</a></h4><p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&rsquo;s shown in the table&rsquo;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4 id=spellcasting-ability-6>Spellcasting Ability
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-ability-6>#</a></h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4 id=spellcasting-focus-5>Spellcasting Focus
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-focus-5>#</a></h4><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p><h3 id=eldritch-invocations>Eldritch Invocations
<a class=anchor href=#eldritch-invocations>#</a></h3><p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</p><p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p><h3 id=pact-boon>Pact Boon
<a class=anchor href=#pact-boon>#</a></h3><p>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p><h4 id=pact-of-the-chain>Pact of the Chain
<a class=anchor href=#pact-of-the-chain>#</a></h4><p>You learn the <em>find familiar</em> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of spells known.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</p><p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.</p><h4 id=pact-of-the-blade>Pact of the Blade
<a class=anchor href=#pact-of-the-blade>#</a></h4><p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can&rsquo;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p><h4 id=pact-of-the-tome>Pact of the Tome
<a class=anchor href=#pact-of-the-tome>#</a></h4><p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class&rsquo;s spell list (the three needn&rsquo;t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don&rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don&rsquo;t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</p><p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p><h3 id=ability-score-improvement-10>Ability Score Improvement
<a class=anchor href=#ability-score-improvement-10>#</a></h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3 id=mystic-arcanum>Mystic Arcanum
<a class=anchor href=#mystic-arcanum>#</a></h3><p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p><p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p><p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p><h3 id=eldritch-master>Eldritch Master
<a class=anchor href=#eldritch-master>#</a></h3><p>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p><h3 id=eldritch-invocations-1>Eldritch Invocations
<a class=anchor href=#eldritch-invocations-1>#</a></h3><p>If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p><h4 id=agonizing-blast>Agonizing Blast
<a class=anchor href=#agonizing-blast>#</a></h4><p><em>Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip</em></p><p>When you cast <em>eldritch blast</em>, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.</p><h4 id=armor-of-shadows>Armor of Shadows

<a class=anchor href=#book-of-ancient-secrets>#</a></h4><p><em>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</em></p><p>You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class&rsquo;s spell list (the two needn&rsquo;t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can&rsquo;t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you&rsquo;ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p><p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell&rsquo;s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p><h4 id=chains-of-carceri>Chains of Carceri
<a class=anchor href=#chains-of-carceri>#</a></h4><p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature</em></p><p>You can cast <em>hold monster</em> at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature&rsquo;s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.</p><h4 id=lifedrinker>Lifedrinker

<a class=anchor href=#otherworldly-patrons>#</a></h2><p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p><p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p><h3 id=the-fiend>The Fiend
<a class=anchor href=#the-fiend>#</a></h3><p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz&rsquo;Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.</p><h4 id=expanded-spell-list>Expanded Spell List

<a class=anchor href=#dark-ones-blessing>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).</p><h4 id=dark-ones-own-luck>Dark One&rsquo;s Own Luck
<a class=anchor href=#dark-ones-own-luck>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor.

<a class=anchor href=#fiendish-resilience>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p><h4 id=hurl-through-hell>Hurl Through Hell
<a class=anchor href=#hurl-through-hell>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.</p><p>At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your Pact Boon</strong></p><p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron&rsquo;s nature.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Chain</strong></em>. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One&rsquo;s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade</strong></em>. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome</strong></em>. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.</p></blockquote><h1 id=wizard>Wizard

<a class=anchor href=#cantrips-5>#</a></h4><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p><h4 id=spellbook>Spellbook
<a class=anchor href=#spellbook>#</a></h4><p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p><h4 id=preparing-and-casting-spells-3>Preparing and Casting Spells
<a class=anchor href=#preparing-and-casting-spells-3>#</a></h4><p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you&rsquo;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>magic missile</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4 id=spellcasting-ability-7>Spellcasting Ability
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-ability-7>#</a></h4><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h4 id=ritual-casting-3>Ritual Casting

<a class=anchor href=#learning-spells-of-1st-level-and-higher>#</a></h4><p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo;).</p><h3 id=arcane-recovery>Arcane Recovery
<a class=anchor href=#arcane-recovery>#</a></h3><p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p><p>For example, if you&rsquo;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p><h3 id=arcane-tradition>Arcane Tradition
<a class=anchor href=#arcane-tradition>#</a></h3><p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3 id=ability-score-improvement-11>Ability Score Improvement

<a class=anchor href=#spell-mastery>#</a></h3><p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p><p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p><h3 id=signature-spells>Signature Spells
<a class=anchor href=#signature-spells>#</a></h3><p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p><h2 id=arcane-traditions>Arcane Traditions
<a class=anchor href=#arcane-traditions>#</a></h2><p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p><h3 id=school-of-evocation>School of Evocation
<a class=anchor href=#school-of-evocation>#</a></h3><p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p><h4 id=evocation-savant>Evocation Savant
<a class=anchor href=#evocation-savant>#</a></h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4 id=sculpt-spells>Sculpt Spells
<a class=anchor href=#sculpt-spells>#</a></h4><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p><h4 id=potent-cantrip>Potent Cantrip
<a class=anchor href=#potent-cantrip>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip&rsquo;s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p><h4 id=empowered-evocation>Empowered Evocation
<a class=anchor href=#empowered-evocation>#</a></h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p><h4 id=overchannel>Overchannel
<a class=anchor href=#overchannel>#</a></h4><p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p><p>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your Spellbook</strong></p><p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></em>. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><p><em><strong>Replacing the Book</strong></em>. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><p>*If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p><em><strong>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance</strong></em>. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p></blockquote><h1 id=customizations>Customizations
<a class=anchor href=#customizations>#</a></h1><h1 id=multiclassing>Multiclassing
<a class=anchor href=#multiclassing>#</a></h1><p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.</p><p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you&rsquo;re a 5th-level character.</p><p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you&rsquo;ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.</p><h2 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites
<a class=anchor href=#prerequisites>#</a></h2><p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.</p><p><strong>Table- Multiclassing Prerequisites</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Ability Score Min.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Strength 13</td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td></tr><tr><td>Monk</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Dexterity 13</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=experience-points>Experience Points
<a class=anchor href=#experience-points>#</a></h2><p>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.</p><h2 id=hit-points-and-hit-dice>Hit Points and Hit Dice
<a class=anchor href=#hit-points-and-hit-dice>#</a></h2><p>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.</p><p>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.</p><h2 id=proficiency-bonus>Proficiency Bonus
<a class=anchor href=#proficiency-bonus>#</a></h2><p>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.</p><h2 id=proficiencies-12>Proficiencies
<a class=anchor href=#proficiencies-12>#</a></h2><p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class&rsquo;s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.</p><p><strong>Table- Multiclassing Proficiencies</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Proficiencies Gained</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Monk</td><td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class&rsquo;s skill list</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Light armor, one skill from the class&rsquo;s skill list, thieves&rsquo; tools</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Light armor, simple weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=class-features-12>Class Features
<a class=anchor href=#class-features-12>#</a></h1><p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don&rsquo;t, however, receive the class&rsquo;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you&rsquo;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p><h2 id=channel-divinity-3>Channel Divinity
<a class=anchor href=#channel-divinity-3>#</a></h2><p>If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn&rsquo;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.</p><h2 id=extra-attack-5>Extra Attack
<a class=anchor href=#extra-attack-5>#</a></h2><p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don&rsquo;t add together. You can&rsquo;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter&rsquo;s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock&rsquo;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn&rsquo;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p><h2 id=unarmored-defense-2>Unarmored Defense
<a class=anchor href=#unarmored-defense-2>#</a></h2><p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can&rsquo;t gain it again from another class.</p><h2 id=spellcasting-7>Spellcasting
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-7>#</a></h2><p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known and Prepared</strong></em>. You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p><p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.</p><p>If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots</strong></em>. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p><p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like <em>burning hands</em>, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don&rsquo;t have any spells of that higher level.</p><p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.

<a class=anchor href=#feats>#</a></h1><p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.</p><p>At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat&rsquo;s description says otherwise.</p><p>You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat&rsquo;s prerequisite, you can&rsquo;t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow-perhaps by a withering curse-you can&rsquo;t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.</p><h2 id=grappler>Grappler

<a class=anchor href=#personalization>#</a></h1><h1 id=alignment-1>Alignment
<a class=anchor href=#alignment-1>#</a></h1><p>A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.</p><p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p><p><strong>Lawful good</strong> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</p><p><strong>Neutral good</strong> (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</p><p><strong>Chaotic good</strong> (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</p><p><strong>Lawful neutral</strong> (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</p><p><strong>Neutral</strong> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don&rsquo;t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</p><p><strong>Chaotic neutral</strong> (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</p><p><strong>Lawful evil</strong> (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</p><p><strong>Neutral evil</strong> (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.</p><p><strong>Chaotic evil</strong> (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</p><h2 id=alignment-in-the-multiverse>Alignment in the Multiverse
<a class=anchor href=#alignment-in-the-multiverse>#</a></h2><p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p><p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god&rsquo;s influence.)</p><p>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn&rsquo;t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p><p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are <strong>unaligned</strong>. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.</p><h1 id=languages-1>Languages

<a class=anchor href=#backgrounds>#</a></h1><p>Every story has a beginning. Your character&rsquo;s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.</p><p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character&rsquo;s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is <em>what changed</em>? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don&rsquo;t you have <em>more</em> money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p><p>The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p><h3 id=proficiencies-13>Proficiencies
<a class=anchor href=#proficiencies-13>#</a></h3><p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in &ldquo;Using Ability Scores&rdquo;).</p><p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;).</p><p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p><h3 id=languages-2>Languages

To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can&rsquo;t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can&rsquo;t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.</p><h2 id=acolyte>Acolyte
<a class=anchor href=#acolyte>#</a></h2><p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p><p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in &ldquo;Fantasy-Historical Pantheons&rdquo; or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Insight, Religion</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</p><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp</p><h3 id=feature-shelter-of-the-faithful>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
<a class=anchor href=#feature-shelter-of-the-faithful>#</a></h3><p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p><p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home.

<a class=anchor href=#coinage>#</a></h2><p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p><p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The old piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&rsquo;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p><p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&rsquo;s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&rsquo;s rest in a poor inn.</p><p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p><p>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions.

<a class=anchor href=#selling-treasure>#</a></h2><p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.</p><p><em><strong>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment</strong></em>. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.</p><p><em><strong>Magic Items</strong></em>. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn&rsquo;t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won&rsquo;t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.</p><p><em><strong>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects</strong></em>. These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.</p><p><em><strong>Trade Goods</strong></em>. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter.

<a class=anchor href=#armor>#</a></h1><p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p><p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p><p><em><strong>Armor Proficiency</strong></em>. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor&rsquo;s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can&rsquo;t cast spells.</p><p><em><strong>Armor Class (AC)</strong></em>. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy Armor</strong></em>. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer&rsquo;s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows &ldquo;Str 13&rdquo; or &ldquo;Str 15&rdquo; in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer&rsquo;s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><p><em><strong>Stealth</strong></em>. If the Armor table shows &ldquo;Disadvantage&rdquo; in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p><em><strong>Shields</strong></em>. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p><h2 id=light-armor>Light Armor
<a class=anchor href=#light-armor>#</a></h2><p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><em><strong>Padded</strong></em>. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p><p><em><strong>Leather</strong></em>. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p><p><em><strong>Studded Leather</strong></em>. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p><h2 id=medium-armor>Medium Armor
<a class=anchor href=#medium-armor>#</a></h2><p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><em><strong>Hide</strong></em>. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p><p><em><strong>Chain Shirt</strong></em>. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer&rsquo;s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p><p><em><strong>Scale Mail</strong></em>. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><em><strong>Breastplate</strong></em>. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer&rsquo;s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p><p><em><strong>Half Plate</strong></em>. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer&rsquo;s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p><h2 id=heavy-armor>Heavy Armor
<a class=anchor href=#heavy-armor>#</a></h2><p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p><p>Heavy armor doesn&rsquo;t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn&rsquo;t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p><p><em><strong>Ring Mail</strong></em>. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it&rsquo;s usually worn only by those who can&rsquo;t afford better armor.</p><p><em><strong>Chain Mail</strong></em>. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><em><strong>Splint</strong></em>. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding.

<a class=anchor href=#weapons>#</a></h1><p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class&rsquo;s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.</p><p>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A <strong>melee weapon</strong> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a <strong>ranged weapon</strong> is used to attack a target at a distance.</p><h2 id=weapon-proficiency>Weapon Proficiency
<a class=anchor href=#weapon-proficiency>#</a></h2><p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p><p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p><h2 id=weapon-properties>Weapon Properties
<a class=anchor href=#weapon-properties>#</a></h2><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p><p><em><strong>Ammunition</strong></em>. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see &ldquo;Improvised Weapons&rdquo; later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><em><strong>Finesse</strong></em>. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy</strong></em>. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon&rsquo;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p><p><em><strong>Light</strong></em>. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Loading</strong></em>. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><em><strong>Range</strong></em>. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&rsquo;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&rsquo;s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&rsquo;t attack a target beyond the weapon&rsquo;s long range.</p><p><em><strong>Reach</strong></em>. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter ##).</p><p><em><strong>Special</strong></em>. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon&rsquo;s description (see &ldquo;Special Weapons&rdquo; later in this section).</p><p><em><strong>Thrown</strong></em>. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><p><em><strong>Two-Handed</strong></em>. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><p><em><strong>Versatile</strong></em>. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h3 id=improvised-weapons>Improvised Weapons
<a class=anchor href=#improvised-weapons>#</a></h3><p>Sometimes characters don&rsquo;t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p><p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM&rsquo;s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p><p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p><h4 id=silvered-weapons>Silvered Weapons
<a class=anchor href=#silvered-weapons>#</a></h4><p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p><h4 id=special-weapons>Special Weapons
<a class=anchor href=#special-weapons>#</a></h4><p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p><p><em><strong>Lance</strong></em>. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren&rsquo;t mounted.</p><p><em><strong>Net</strong></em>. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p><p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><strong>Table- Weapons</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Cost</th><th>Damage</th><th>Weight</th><th>Properties</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Simple Melee Weapons</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Club</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Dagger</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Greatclub</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Handaxe</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Javelin</td><td>5 sp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td>Light hammer</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Mace</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterstaff</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>Sickle</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Spear</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Simple Ranged Weapons</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, light</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>5 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Dart</td><td>5 cp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1/4 lb.</td><td>Finesse, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Shortbow</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Sling</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>-</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Martial Melee Weapons</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Battleaxe</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Flail</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Glaive</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greataxe</td><td>30 gp</td><td>1d12 slashing</td><td>7 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greatsword</td><td>50 gp</td><td>2d6 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Halberd</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Lance</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d12 piercing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Reach, special</td></tr><tr><td>Longsword</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Maul</td><td>10 gp</td><td>2d6 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Morningstar</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Pike</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Rapier</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse</td></tr><tr><td>Scimitar</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Shortsword</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Trident</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>War pick</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Warhammer</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Whip</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, reach</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Martial Ranged Weapons</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 25/100), loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, hand</td><td>75 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120), light, loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, heavy</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Longbow</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Net</td><td>1 gp</td><td>-</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Special, thrown (range 5/15)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=adventuring-gear>Adventuring Gear
<a class=anchor href=#adventuring-gear>#</a></h1><p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.</p><p><em><strong>Acid</strong></em>. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p><p><em><strong>Alchemist&rsquo;s Fire</strong></em>. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist&rsquo;s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p><p><em><strong>Antitoxin</strong></em>. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p><p><em><strong>Arcane Focus</strong></em>. An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item- designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><em><strong>Ball Bearings</strong></em>. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn&rsquo;t need to make the save.</p><p><em><strong>Block and Tackle</strong></em>. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p><p><em><strong>Book</strong></em>. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p><p><em><strong>Caltrops</strong></em>. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature&rsquo;s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn&rsquo;t need to make the save.</p><p><em><strong>Candle</strong></em>. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Case, Crossbow Bolt</strong></em>. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p><p><em><strong>Case, Map or Scroll</strong></em>. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p><p><em><strong>Chain</strong></em>. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p><p><em><strong>Climber&rsquo;s Kit</strong></em>. A climber&rsquo;s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber&rsquo;s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can&rsquo;t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can&rsquo;t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p><p><em><strong>Component Pouch</strong></em>. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell&rsquo;s description).</p><p><em><strong>Crowbar</strong></em>. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar&rsquo;s leverage can be applied.</p><p><em><strong>Druidic Focus</strong></em>. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><em><strong>Fishing Tackle</strong></em>. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer&rsquo;s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p><em><strong>Holy Symbol</strong></em>. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B &ldquo;Fantasy-Historical Pantheons&rdquo; lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p><p><em><strong>Holy Water</strong></em>. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p><p><em><strong>Hunting Trap</strong></em>. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p><p><em><strong>Lamp</strong></em>. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p><p><em><strong>Lock</strong></em>. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves&rsquo; tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p><p><em><strong>Magnifying Glass</strong></em>. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.</p><p><em><strong>Manacles</strong></em>. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves&rsquo; tools can pick the manacles&rsquo; lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Mess Kit</strong></em>. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p><p><em><strong>Oil</strong></em>. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p><p><em><strong>Poison, Basic</strong></em>. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p><p><em><strong>Potion of Healing</strong></em>. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p><p><em><strong>Pouch</strong></em>. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p><p><em><strong>Rations</strong></em>. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p><p><em><strong>Rope</strong></em>. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p><p><em><strong>Scale, Merchant&rsquo;s</strong></em>. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p><p><em><strong>Spellbook</strong></em>. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spyglass</strong></em>. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p><p><em><strong>Tent</strong></em>. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p><p><em><strong>Tinderbox</strong></em>. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p><p><em><strong>Torch</strong></em>. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p><p><strong>Equipment Packs</strong></p><p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.</p><p><em><strong>Burglar&rsquo;s Pack (16 gp)</strong></em>. Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.</p><p><em><strong>Diplomat&rsquo;s Pack (39 gp)</strong></em>. Includes a chest, 2 cases for maps and scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a lamp, 2 flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of perfume, sealing wax, and soap.</p><p><em><strong>Dungeoneer&rsquo;s Pack (12 gp)</strong></em>. Includes a backpack, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.</p><p><em><strong>Entertainer&rsquo;s Pack (40 gp)</strong></em>.

<a class=anchor href=#tools>#</a></h1><p>A tool helps you to do something you couldn&rsquo;t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver&rsquo;s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.</p><p><strong>Table- Tools</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost</th><th>Weight</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Artisan&rsquo;s tools</em></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>~ Alchemist&rsquo;s supplies</td><td>50 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Brewer&rsquo;s supplies</td><td>20 gp</td><td>9 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Calligrapher&rsquo;s supplies</td><td>10 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Carpenter&rsquo;s tools</td><td>8 gp</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Cartographer&rsquo;s tools</td><td>15 gp</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Cobbler&rsquo;s tools</td><td>5 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Cook&rsquo;s utensils</td><td>1 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Glassblower&rsquo;s tools</td><td>30 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Jeweler&rsquo;s tools</td><td>25 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Leatherworker&rsquo;s tools</td><td>5 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Mason&rsquo;s tools</td><td>10 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Painter&rsquo;s supplies</td><td>10 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Potter&rsquo;s tools</td><td>10 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Smith&rsquo;s tools</td><td>20 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Tinker&rsquo;s tools</td><td>50 gp</td><td>10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Weaver&rsquo;s tools</td><td>1 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Woodcarver&rsquo;s tools</td><td>1 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Disguise kit</td><td>25 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Forgery kit</td><td>15 gp</td><td>5 lb.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Gaming set</em></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>~ Dice set</td><td>1 sp</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>~ Playing card set</td><td>5 sp</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>~ Herbalism kit</td><td>5 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Musical instrument</em></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>~ Bagpipes</td><td>30 gp</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Drum</td><td>6 gp</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Dulcimer</td><td>25 gp</td><td>10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Flute</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Lute</td><td>35 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Lyre</td><td>30 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Horn</td><td>3 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Pan flute</td><td>12 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Shawm</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Viol</td><td>30 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Navigator&rsquo;s tools</td><td>25 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Poisoner&rsquo;s kit</td><td>50 gp</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Thieves&rsquo; tools</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles (land or water)</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* See the &ldquo;Mounts and Vehicles&rdquo; section.</p><p><em><strong>Artisan&rsquo;s Tools</strong></em>. These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan&rsquo;s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan&rsquo;s tools requires a separate proficiency.</p><p><em><strong>Disguise Kit</strong></em>. This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.</p><p><em><strong>Forgery Kit</strong></em>. This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.</p><p><em><strong>Gaming Set</strong></em>. This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.</p><p><em><strong>Herbalism Kit</strong></em>. This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.</p><p><em><strong>Musical Instrument</strong></em>. Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.</p><p><em><strong>Navigator&rsquo;s Tools</strong></em>. This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator&rsquo;s tools lets you chart a ship&rsquo;s course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.</p><p><em><strong>Poisoner&rsquo;s Kit</strong></em>. A poisoner&rsquo;s kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.</p><p><em><strong>Thieves&rsquo; Tools</strong></em>. This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks.</p><h1 id=mounts-and-vehicles>Mounts and Vehicles
<a class=anchor href=#mounts-and-vehicles>#</a></h1><p>A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal&rsquo;s speed and base carrying capacity.</p><p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p><p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.</p><p><em><strong>Barding</strong></em>. Barding is armor designed to protect an animal&rsquo;s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.</p><p><em><strong>Saddles</strong></em>. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.</p><p><em><strong>Vehicle Proficiency</strong></em>. If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.</p><p><em><strong>Rowed Vessels</strong></em>. Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can&rsquo;t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.</p><p><strong>Table- Mounts and Other Animals</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost</th><th>Speed</th><th>Carrying Capacity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Camel</td><td>50 gp</td><td>50 ft.</td><td>480 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Donkey or mule</td><td>8 gp</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>420 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Elephant</td><td>200 gp</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>1,320 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Horse, draft</td><td>50 gp</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>540 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Horse, riding</td><td>75 gp</td><td>60 ft.</td><td>480 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Mastiff</td><td>25 gp</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>195 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Pony</td><td>30 gp</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>225 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Warhorse</td><td>400 gp</td><td>60 ft.</td><td>540 lb.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost</th><th>Weight</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Barding</td><td>×4</td><td>×2</td></tr><tr><td>Bit and bridle</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Carriage</td><td>100 gp</td><td>600 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Cart</td><td>15 gp</td><td>200 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Chariot</td><td>250 gp</td><td>100 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Feed (per day)</td><td>5 cp</td><td>10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Saddle</em></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>~ Exotic</td><td>60 gp</td><td>40 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Military</td><td>20 gp</td><td>30 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Pack</td><td>5 gp</td><td>15 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>~ Riding</td><td>10 gp</td><td>25 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Saddlebags</td><td>4 gp</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Sled</td><td>20 gp</td><td>300 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Stabling (per day)</td><td>5 sp</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Wagon</td><td>35 gp</td><td>400 lb.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Waterborne Vehicles</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost</th><th>Speed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Galley</td><td>30,000 gp</td><td>4 mph</td></tr><tr><td>Keelboat</td><td>3,000 gp</td><td>1 mph</td></tr><tr><td>Longship</td><td>10,000 gp</td><td>3 mph</td></tr><tr><td>Rowboat</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1½ mph</td></tr><tr><td>Sailing ship</td><td>10,000 gp</td><td>2 mph</td></tr><tr><td>Warship</td><td>25,000 gp</td><td>2½ mph</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=trade-goods>Trade Goods

<a class=anchor href=#expenses>#</a></h1><p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.</p><h2 id=lifestyle-expenses>Lifestyle Expenses
<a class=anchor href=#lifestyle-expenses>#</a></h2><p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p><p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character&rsquo;s career.</p><p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p><p><strong>Table- Lifestyle Expenses</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Lifestyle</th><th>Price/Day</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wretched</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Squalid</td><td>1 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Poor</td><td>2 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Modest</td><td>1 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>2 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>4 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>10 gp minimum</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Wretched</strong></em>. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p><p><em><strong>Squalid</strong></em>. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p><p><em><strong>Poor</strong></em>. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.</p><p><em><strong>Modest</strong></em>. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don&rsquo;t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p><p><em><strong>Comfortable</strong></em>. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p><p><em><strong>Wealthy</strong></em>. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p><p><em><strong>Aristocratic</strong></em>. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p><h2 id=food-drink-and-lodging>Food, Drink, and Lodging
<a class=anchor href=#food-drink-and-lodging>#</a></h2><p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night&rsquo;s lodging.

Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p><p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn&rsquo;t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p></blockquote><h2 id=services>Services
<a class=anchor href=#services>#</a></h2><p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the <em>secret chest</em> spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p><p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p><p><strong>Table- Services</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Service Pay</th><th>Pay</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Coach cab</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>~ Between towns</td><td>3 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td>~ Within a city</td><td>1 cp</td></tr><tr><td><em>Hireling</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>~ Skilled</td><td>2 gp per day</td></tr><tr><td>~ Untrained</td><td>2 sp per day</td></tr><tr><td>Messenger</td><td>2 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td>Road or gate toll</td><td>1 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Ship&rsquo;s passage</td><td>1 sp per mile</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=spellcasting-services>Spellcasting Services
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-services>#</a></h2><p>People who are able to cast spells don&rsquo;t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as <em>cure wounds</em> or <em>identify</em>, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p><h1 id=abilities>Abilities
<a class=anchor href=#abilities>#</a></h1><p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature&rsquo;s physical and mental characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Strength</strong>, measuring physical power</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>, measuring agility</li><li><strong>Constitution</strong>, measuring endurance</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>, measuring reasoning and memory</li><li><strong>Wisdom</strong>, measuring perception and insight</li><li><strong>Charisma</strong>, measuring force of personality</li></ul><p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature&rsquo;s assets as well as weaknesses.</p><p>The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book&rsquo;s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.</p><h2 id=ability-scores-and-modifiers>Ability Scores and Modifiers
<a class=anchor href=#ability-scores-and-modifiers>#</a></h2><p>Each of a creature&rsquo;s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature&rsquo;s training and competence in activities related to that ability.</p><p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p><p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p><p><strong>Table- Ability Scores and Modifiers</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>2-3</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>18-19</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>20-21</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>22-23</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>24-25</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>26-27</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>28-29</td><td>+9</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).</p><p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p><h1 id=advantage-and-disadvantage>Advantage and Disadvantage
<a class=anchor href=#advantage-and-disadvantage>#</a></h1><p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p><p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don&rsquo;t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p><p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p><p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling&rsquo;s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p><p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The</p><p>GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p><h1 id=proficiency-bonus-1>Proficiency Bonus
<a class=anchor href=#proficiency-bonus-1>#</a></h1><p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus can&rsquo;t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p><p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue&rsquo;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p><p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn&rsquo;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don&rsquo;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p><p>In general, you don&rsquo;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p><h1 id=ability-checks>Ability Checks
<a class=anchor href=#ability-checks>#</a></h1><p>An ability check tests a character&rsquo;s or monster&rsquo;s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p><p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.</p><p>The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p><p><strong>Table- Difficulty Classes</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Task Difficulty</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Very easy</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hard</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Very hard</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Nearly impossible</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.</p><h2 id=contests>Contests
<a class=anchor href=#contests>#</a></h2><p>Sometimes one character&rsquo;s or monster&rsquo;s efforts are directly opposed to another&rsquo;s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal- for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p><p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p><p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p><h2 id=skills>Skills
<a class=anchor href=#skills>#</a></h2><p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual&rsquo;s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character&rsquo;s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster&rsquo;s skill proficiencies appear in the monster&rsquo;s stat block.)</p><p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character&rsquo;s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p><p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability&rsquo;s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.</p><p><strong>Table- Related Skills</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Strength</th><th>Dexterity</th><th>Intelligence</th><th>Wisdom</th><th>Charisma</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Athletics</td><td>Acrobatics</td><td>Arcana</td><td>Animal Handling</td><td>Deception</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sleight of Hand</td><td>History</td><td>Insight</td><td>Intimidation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Stealth</td><td>Investigation</td><td>Medicine</td><td>Performance</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Nature</td><td>Perception</td><td>Persuasion</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Religion</td><td>Survival</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, &ldquo;Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.&rdquo; At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p><p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character&rsquo;s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p><h3 id=variant-skills-with-different-abilities>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities
<a class=anchor href=#variant-skills-with-different-abilities>#</a></h3><p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you&rsquo;re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p><h2 id=passive-checks>Passive Checks
<a class=anchor href=#passive-checks>#</a></h2><p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn&rsquo;t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how to determine a character&rsquo;s total for a passive check:</p><p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p><p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <strong>score</strong>.</p><p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.</p><p>The rules on hiding in the &ldquo;Dexterity&rdquo; section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.</p><h2 id=working-together>Working Together
<a class=anchor href=#working-together>#</a></h2><p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who&rsquo;s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.</p><p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves&rsquo; tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can&rsquo;t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p><h3 id=group-checks>Group Checks
<a class=anchor href=#group-checks>#</a></h3><p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren&rsquo;t.</p><p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p><p>Group checks don&rsquo;t come up very often, and they&rsquo;re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p><h2 id=using-each-ability>Using Each Ability
<a class=anchor href=#using-each-ability>#</a></h2><p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.</p><h3 id=strength>Strength
<a class=anchor href=#strength>#</a></h3><p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</p><h4 id=strength-checks>Strength Checks
<a class=anchor href=#strength-checks>#</a></h4><p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.</p><p><em><strong>Athletics</strong></em>. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p><ul><li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li><li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li><li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Other Strength Checks</strong></em>. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li><li>Break free of bonds</li><li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li><li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li><li>Tip over a statue</li><li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li></ul><h4 id=attack-rolls-and-damage>Attack Rolls and Damage
<a class=anchor href=#attack-rolls-and-damage>#</a></h4><p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p><h4 id=lifting-and-carrying>Lifting and Carrying
<a class=anchor href=#lifting-and-carrying>#</a></h4><p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p><p><em><strong>Carrying Capacity</strong></em>. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don&rsquo;t usually have to worry about it.</p><p><em><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift</strong></em>. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Size and Strength</strong></em>. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature&rsquo;s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p><h4 id=variant-encumbrance>Variant: Encumbrance
<a class=anchor href=#variant-encumbrance>#</a></h4><p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead <strong>heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p><h3 id=dexterity>Dexterity
<a class=anchor href=#dexterity>#</a></h3><p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p><h4 id=dexterity-checks>Dexterity Checks
<a class=anchor href=#dexterity-checks>#</a></h4><p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p><p><em><strong>Acrobatics</strong></em>. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you&rsquo;re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship&rsquo;s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p><p><em><strong>Sleight of Hand</strong></em>. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person&rsquo;s pocket.</p><p><em><strong>Stealth</strong></em>. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p><p><em><strong>Other Dexterity Checks</strong></em>. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li><li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li><li>Pick a lock</li><li>Disable a trap</li><li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li><li>Wriggle free of bonds</li><li>Play a stringed instrument</li><li>Craft a small or detailed object</li></ul><h4 id=attack-rolls-and-damage-1>Attack Rolls and Damage
<a class=anchor href=#attack-rolls-and-damage-1>#</a></h4><p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p><h4 id=armor-class>Armor Class
<a class=anchor href=#armor-class>#</a></h4><p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.</p><h4 id=initiative>Initiative
<a class=anchor href=#initiative>#</a></h4><p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures&rsquo; turns in combat.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Hiding</strong></p><p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check&rsquo;s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.</p><p>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p><p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p><p><em><strong>Passive Perception</strong></em>. When you hide, there&rsquo;s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren&rsquo;t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p><p><em><strong>What Can You See?</strong></em> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured</strong>, as explained in the &ldquo;Adventuring&rdquo; section.</p></blockquote><h3 id=constitution>Constitution
<a class=anchor href=#constitution>#</a></h3><p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p><h4 id=constitution-checks>Constitution Checks
<a class=anchor href=#constitution-checks>#</a></h4><p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p><p>The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Hold your breath</li><li>March or labor for hours without rest</li><li>Go without sleep</li><li>Survive without food or water</li><li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li></ul><h4 id=hit-points-12>Hit Points
<a class=anchor href=#hit-points-12>#</a></h4><p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p><p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you&rsquo;re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p><h3 id=intelligence>Intelligence
<a class=anchor href=#intelligence>#</a></h3><p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p><h4 id=intelligence-checks>Intelligence Checks
<a class=anchor href=#intelligence-checks>#</a></h4><p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.</p><p><em><strong>Arcana</strong></em>. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.</p><p><em><strong>History</strong></em>. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p><p><em><strong>Investigation</strong></em>. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p><p><em><strong>Nature</strong></em>. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p><p><em><strong>Religion</strong></em>. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p><p><em><strong>Other Intelligence Checks</strong></em>. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li><li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li><li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li><li>Forge a document</li><li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li><li>Win a game of skill</li></ul><h4 id=spellcasting-ability-8>Spellcasting Ability
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-ability-8>#</a></h4><p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h3 id=wisdom>Wisdom
<a class=anchor href=#wisdom>#</a></h3><p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p><h4 id=wisdom-checks>Wisdom Checks
<a class=anchor href=#wisdom-checks>#</a></h4><p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone&rsquo;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p><p><em><strong>Animal Handling</strong></em>. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal&rsquo;s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p><p><em><strong>Insight</strong></em>. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone&rsquo;s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p><p><em><strong>Medicine</strong></em>. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p><p><em><strong>Perception</strong></em>. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p><p><em><strong>Survival</strong></em>. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p><p><em><strong>Other Wisdom Checks</strong></em>. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li><li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li></ul><h4 id=spellcasting-ability-9>Spellcasting Ability
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-ability-9>#</a></h4><p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h3 id=charisma>Charisma
<a class=anchor href=#charisma>#</a></h3><p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p><h4 id=charisma-checks>Charisma Checks
<a class=anchor href=#charisma-checks>#</a></h4><p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p><p><em><strong>Deception</strong></em>. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone&rsquo;s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p><p><em><strong>Intimidation</strong></em>. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p><p><em><strong>Performance</strong></em>. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p><p><em><strong>Persuasion</strong></em>. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p><p><em><strong>Other Charisma Checks</strong></em>. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li><li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li></ul><h4 id=spellcasting-ability-10>Spellcasting Ability
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-ability-10>#</a></h4><p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h1 id=saving-throws>Saving Throws
<a class=anchor href=#saving-throws>#</a></h1><p>A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don&rsquo;t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p><p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p><p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.</p><p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p><p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster&rsquo;s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p><p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p><h1 id=adventuring>Adventuring
<a class=anchor href=#adventuring>#</a></h1><h1 id=time>Time
<a class=anchor href=#time>#</a></h1><p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers&rsquo; movement happens on a scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p><p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours&rsquo; time.</p><p>For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best.</p><p>Following the road from Baldur&rsquo;s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p><p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on <strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time.</p><h1 id=movement>Movement
<a class=anchor href=#movement>#</a></h1><p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p><p>The GM can summarize the adventurers&rsquo; movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: &ldquo;You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.&rdquo; Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: &ldquo;After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they&rsquo;re moving over.</p><h2 id=speed-1>Speed
<a class=anchor href=#speed-1>#</a></h2><p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.</p><p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><h3 id=travel-pace>Travel Pace
<a class=anchor href=#travel-pace>#</a></h3><p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p><p><em><strong>Forced March</strong></em>. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p><p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix ##).</p><p><em><strong>Mounts and Vehicles</strong></em>. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p><p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don&rsquo;t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p><p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a <em>carpet of flying</em>, allow you to travel more swiftly.</p><p><strong>Table- Travel Pace</strong></p><p><strong>Distance Traveled Per &mldr;</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pace</th><th>Minute</th><th>Hour</th><th>Day</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fast</td><td>400 feet</td><td>4 miles</td><td>30 miles</td><td>-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td></tr><tr><td>Normal</td><td>300 feet</td><td>3 miles</td><td>18 miles</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Slow</td><td>200 feet</td><td>2 miles</td><td>24 miles</td><td>Able to use stealth</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=difficult-terrain>Difficult Terrain
<a class=anchor href=#difficult-terrain>#</a></h3><p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult terrain.</p><p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain- moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><h2 id=special-types-of-movement>Special Types of Movement
<a class=anchor href=#special-types-of-movement>#</a></h2><p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p><h3 id=climbing-swimming-and-crawling>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling
<a class=anchor href=#climbing-swimming-and-crawling>#</a></h3><p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM&rsquo;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p><h3 id=jumping>Jumping
<a class=anchor href=#jumping>#</a></h3><p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p><p><em><strong>Long Jump</strong></em>. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p><p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn&rsquo;t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM&rsquo;s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump&rsquo;s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p><p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p><p><em><strong>High Jump</strong></em>. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p><p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.</p><h1 id=the-environment>The Environment
<a class=anchor href=#the-environment>#</a></h1><p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.</p><h2 id=falling>Falling
<a class=anchor href=#falling>#</a></h2><p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p><h2 id=suffocating>Suffocating
<a class=anchor href=#suffocating>#</a></h2><p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p><p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p><p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p><h2 id=vision-and-light>Vision and Light
<a class=anchor href=#vision-and-light>#</a></h2><p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring- noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character&rsquo;s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p><p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a <strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p><p>A <strong>heavily obscured</strong> area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix ##) when trying to see something in that area.</p><p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p><p><strong>Bright light</strong> lets most creatures see normally.</p><p>Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p><p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p><p><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area.</p><p>Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p><h3 id=blindsight>Blindsight
<a class=anchor href=#blindsight>#</a></h3><p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.</p><h3 id=darkvision>Darkvision
<a class=anchor href=#darkvision>#</a></h3><p>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><h3 id=truesight>Truesight
<a class=anchor href=#truesight>#</a></h3><p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p><h2 id=food-and-water>Food and Water
<a class=anchor href=#food-and-water>#</a></h2><p>Characters who don&rsquo;t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix ##). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can&rsquo;t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p><h3 id=food>Food
<a class=anchor href=#food>#</a></h3><p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p><p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.</p><p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p><h3 id=water>Water
<a class=anchor href=#water>#</a></h3><p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p><p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p><h2 id=interacting-with-objects>Interacting with Objects
<a class=anchor href=#interacting-with-objects>#</a></h2><p>A character&rsquo;s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.</p><p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p><p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object&rsquo;s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It&rsquo;s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p><p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p><h1 id=resting>Resting
<a class=anchor href=#resting>#</a></h1><p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can&rsquo;t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.</p><p>Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.</p><h2 id=short-rest>Short Rest
<a class=anchor href=#short-rest>#</a></h2><p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.</p><p>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character&rsquo;s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character&rsquo;s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character&rsquo;s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.</p><h2 id=long-rest>Long Rest
<a class=anchor href=#long-rest>#</a></h2><p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p><p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character&rsquo;s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p><p>A character can&rsquo;t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p><h1 id=between-adventures>Between Adventures
<a class=anchor href=#between-adventures>#</a></h1><p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p><p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p><h2 id=lifestyle-expenses-1>Lifestyle Expenses
<a class=anchor href=#lifestyle-expenses-1>#</a></h2><p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p><p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn&rsquo;t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p><h2 id=downtime-activities>Downtime Activities
<a class=anchor href=#downtime-activities>#</a></h2><p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p><p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p><h3 id=crafting>Crafting
<a class=anchor href=#crafting>#</a></h3><p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan&rsquo;s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith&rsquo;s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p><p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5 gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p><p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.</p><h3 id=practicing-a-profession>Practicing a Profession
<a class=anchor href=#practicing-a-profession>#</a></h3><p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.</p><p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves&rsquo; guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p><p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p><h3 id=recuperating>Recuperating
<a class=anchor href=#recuperating>#</a></h3><p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p><p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:</p><ul><li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li><li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li></ul><h3 id=researching>Researching
<a class=anchor href=#researching>#</a></h3><p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.</p><p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone&rsquo;s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.</p><p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.</p><h3 id=training>Training
<a class=anchor href=#training>#</a></h3><p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.</p><p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.</p><p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p><h1 id=combat>Combat
<a class=anchor href=#combat>#</a></h1><p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A <strong>round</strong> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <strong>turn</strong>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p><blockquote><h1 id=combat-step-by-step>Combat Step by Step
<a class=anchor href=#combat-step-by-step>#</a></h1><ol><li><strong>Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li><li><strong>Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers&rsquo; marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.</li><li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants&rsquo; turns.</li><li><strong>Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li><li><strong>Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id=surprise>Surprise
<a class=anchor href=#surprise>#</a></h2><p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p><p>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn&rsquo;t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re surprised, you can&rsquo;t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can&rsquo;t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren&rsquo;t.</p><h2 id=initiative-1>Initiative
<a class=anchor href=#initiative-1>#</a></h2><p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p><p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p><p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p><h2 id=your-turn>Your Turn
<a class=anchor href=#your-turn>#</a></h2><p>On your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> a distance up to your speed and <strong>take one action</strong>. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed- sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet.</p><p>The most common actions you can take are described in the &ldquo;Actions in Combat&rdquo; section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p><p>The &ldquo;Movement and Position&rdquo; section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.</p><p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can&rsquo;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in &ldquo;Actions in Combat.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=bonus-actions>Bonus Actions
<a class=anchor href=#bonus-actions>#</a></h2><p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don&rsquo;t have a bonus action to take.</p><p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p><p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action&rsquo;s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p><h2 id=other-activity-on-your-turn>Other Activity on Your Turn
<a class=anchor href=#other-activity-on-your-turn>#</a></h2><p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p><p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p><p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p><p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p><p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p><h1 id=reactions>Reactions
<a class=anchor href=#reactions>#</a></h1><p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else&rsquo;s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p><p>When you take a reaction, you can&rsquo;t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature&rsquo;s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p><h1 id=movement-and-position>Movement and Position
<a class=anchor href=#movement-and-position>#</a></h1><p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p><p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p><p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you&rsquo;re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p><h2 id=breaking-up-your-move>Breaking Up Your Move
<a class=anchor href=#breaking-up-your-move>#</a></h2><p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p><h3 id=moving-between-attacks>Moving between Attacks
<a class=anchor href=#moving-between-attacks>#</a></h3><p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p><h3 id=using-different-speeds>Using Different Speeds
<a class=anchor href=#using-different-speeds>#</a></h3><p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you&rsquo;ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can&rsquo;t use the new speed during the current move.</p><p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the <em>fly</em> spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p><h2 id=difficult-terrain-1>Difficult Terrain
<a class=anchor href=#difficult-terrain-1>#</a></h2><p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p><p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p><p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p><h2 id=being-prone>Being Prone
<a class=anchor href=#being-prone>#</a></h2><p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.</p><p>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your speed. <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend</p><p>15 feet of movement to stand up. You can&rsquo;t stand up if you don&rsquo;t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Interacting with Objects Around You</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p><ul><li>draw or sheathe a sword</li><li>open or close a door</li><li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li><li>pick up a dropped axe</li><li>take a bauble from a table</li><li>remove a ring from your finger</li><li>stuff some food into your mouth</li><li>plant a banner in the ground</li><li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li><li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li><li>throw a lever or a switch</li><li>pull a torch from a sconce</li><li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li><li>extinguish a small flame</li><li>don a mask</li><li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li><li>put your ear to a door</li><li>kick a small stone</li><li>turn a key in a lock</li><li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li><li>hand an item to another character</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id=moving-around-other-creatures>Moving Around Other Creatures
<a class=anchor href=#moving-around-other-creatures>#</a></h2><p>You can move through a nonhostile creature&rsquo;s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature&rsquo;s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature&rsquo;s space is difficult terrain for you.</p><p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can&rsquo;t willingly end your move in its space.</p><p>If you leave a hostile creature&rsquo;s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p><h2 id=flying-movement>Flying Movement
<a class=anchor href=#flying-movement>#</a></h2><p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the <em>fly</em> spell.</p><h2 id=creature-size>Creature Size
<a class=anchor href=#creature-size>#</a></h2><p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p><p><strong>Table- Creature Size</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Space</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>5 by 5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>5 by 5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>10 by 10 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>15 by 15 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>20 by 20 ft. or larger</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=space>Space
<a class=anchor href=#space>#</a></h3><p>A creature&rsquo;s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn&rsquo;t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway, other creatures can&rsquo;t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p><p>A creature&rsquo;s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there&rsquo;s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p><p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there&rsquo;s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p><h4 id=squeezing-into-a-smaller-space>Squeezing into a Smaller Space
<a class=anchor href=#squeezing-into-a-smaller-space>#</a></h4><p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that&rsquo;s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it&rsquo;s in the smaller space.</p><h1 id=actions-in-combat>Actions in Combat
<a class=anchor href=#actions-in-combat>#</a></h1><p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p><p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p><h2 id=attack>Attack
<a class=anchor href=#attack>#</a></h2><p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p><p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the &ldquo;Making an Attack&rdquo; section for the rules that govern attacks.</p><p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p><h2 id=cast-a-spell>Cast a Spell
<a class=anchor href=#cast-a-spell>#</a></h2><p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.</p><h2 id=dash>Dash
<a class=anchor href=#dash>#</a></h2><p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.</p><p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p><h2 id=disengage>Disengage
<a class=anchor href=#disengage>#</a></h2><p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p><h2 id=dodge>Dodge
<a class=anchor href=#dodge>#</a></h2><p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.</p><h2 id=help>Help
<a class=anchor href=#help>#</a></h2><p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p><p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally&rsquo;s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p><h2 id=hide>Hide
<a class=anchor href=#hide>#</a></h2><p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the &ldquo;Unseen Attackers and Targets&rdquo; section later in this chapter.</p><h2 id=ready>Ready
<a class=anchor href=#ready>#</a></h2><p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p><p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &ldquo;If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I&rsquo;ll pull the lever that opens it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.&rdquo;</p><p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p><p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell&rsquo;s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the <em>web</em> spell and ready <em>magic missile</em>, your <em>web</em> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <em>magic missile</em> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p><h2 id=search>Search
<a class=anchor href=#search>#</a></h2><p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p><h2 id=use-an-object>Use an Object
<a class=anchor href=#use-an-object>#</a></h2><p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p><h1 id=making-an-attack>Making an Attack
<a class=anchor href=#making-an-attack>#</a></h1><p>Whether you&rsquo;re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p><ul><li><strong>Choose a target</strong>. Pick a target within your attack&rsquo;s <strong>Range:</strong> a creature, an object, or a location.</li><li><strong>Determine modifiers</strong>. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li><li><strong>Resolve the attack</strong>. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</li></ul><p>If there&rsquo;s ever any question whether something you&rsquo;re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you&rsquo;re making an attack roll, you&rsquo;re making an attack.</p><h2 id=attack-rolls>Attack Rolls
<a class=anchor href=#attack-rolls>#</a></h2><p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target&rsquo;s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.</p><h3 id=modifiers-to-the-roll>Modifiers to the Roll
<a class=anchor href=#modifiers-to-the-roll>#</a></h3><p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character&rsquo;s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Modifier.</strong></em> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.</p><p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.</p><p><em><strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong></em> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p><h3 id=rolling-1-or-20>Rolling 1 or 20
<a class=anchor href=#rolling-1-or-20>#</a></h3><p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target&rsquo;s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.</p><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target&rsquo;s AC.</p><h2 id=unseen-attackers-and-targets>Unseen Attackers and Targets
<a class=anchor href=#unseen-attackers-and-targets>#</a></h2><p>Combatants often try to escape their foes&rsquo; notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.</p><p>When you attack a target that you can&rsquo;t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you&rsquo;re guessing the target&rsquo;s location or you&rsquo;re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn&rsquo;t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target&rsquo;s location correctly.</p><p>When a creature can&rsquo;t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p><h2 id=ranged-attacks>Ranged Attacks
<a class=anchor href=#ranged-attacks>#</a></h2><p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p><h3 id=range>Range
<a class=anchor href=#range>#</a></h3><p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p><p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can&rsquo;t attack a target beyond this range.</p><p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can&rsquo;t attack a target beyond the long range.</p><h3 id=ranged-attacks-in-close-combat>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
<a class=anchor href=#ranged-attacks-in-close-combat>#</a></h3><p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn&rsquo;t incapacitated.</p><h2 id=melee-attacks>Melee Attacks
<a class=anchor href=#melee-attacks>#</a></h2><p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p><p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p><p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Contests in Combat</strong></em></p><p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.</p></blockquote><h4 id=opportunity-attacks>Opportunity Attacks
<a class=anchor href=#opportunity-attacks>#</a></h4><p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.</p><p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.</p><p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don&rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don&rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe&rsquo;s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p><h3 id=two-weapon-fighting-2>Two-Weapon Fighting
<a class=anchor href=#two-weapon-fighting-2>#</a></h3><p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you&rsquo;re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you&rsquo;re holding in the other hand. You don&rsquo;t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p><p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p><h3 id=grappling>Grappling
<a class=anchor href=#grappling>#</a></h3><p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you&rsquo;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p><p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix ##). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p><p><em><strong>Escaping a Grapple</strong></em>. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p><em><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature</strong></em>. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p><h3 id=shoving-a-creature>Shoving a Creature
<a class=anchor href=#shoving-a-creature>#</a></h3><p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you&rsquo;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p><p>The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.</p><h2 id=cover>Cover
<a class=anchor href=#cover>#</a></h2><p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</p><p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren&rsquo;t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p><p>A target with <strong>half cover</strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p><p>A target with <strong>three-quarters cover</strong> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</p><p>A target with <strong>total cover</strong> can&rsquo;t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p><h2 id=damage-and-healing>Damage and Healing
<a class=anchor href=#damage-and-healing>#</a></h2><p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a <em>fireball</em> spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.</p><h3 id=hit-points-13>Hit Points
<a class=anchor href=#hit-points-13>#</a></h3><p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p><p>A creature&rsquo;s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature&rsquo;s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p><p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature&rsquo;s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p><h3 id=damage-rolls>Damage Rolls
<a class=anchor href=#damage-rolls>#</a></h3><p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p><p>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A <strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p><p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <strong>more than one target</strong> at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts <em>fireball</em> or a cleric casts <em>flame strike</em>, the spell&rsquo;s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p><h3 id=critical-hits>Critical Hits
<a class=anchor href=#critical-hits>#</a></h3><p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack&rsquo;s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack&rsquo;s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p><p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue&rsquo;s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p><h3 id=damage-types>Damage Types
<a class=anchor href=#damage-types>#</a></h3><p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p><p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.</p><p><em><strong>Acid</strong></em>. The corrosive spray of a black dragon&rsquo;s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.</p><p><em><strong>Bludgeoning</strong></em>. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.</p><p><em><strong>Cold</strong></em>. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil&rsquo;s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon&rsquo;s breath deal cold damage.</p><p><em><strong>Fire</strong></em>. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</p><p><em><strong>Force</strong></em>. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including <em>magic missile</em> and <em>spiritual weapon</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning</strong></em>. A <em>lightning bolt</em> spell and a blue dragon&rsquo;s breath deal lightning damage.</p><p><em><strong>Necrotic</strong></em>. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as <em>chill touch</em>, withers matter and even the soul.</p><p><em><strong>Piercing</strong></em>. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters&rsquo; bites, deal piercing damage.</p><p><em><strong>Poison</strong></em>. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon&rsquo;s breath deal poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Psychic</strong></em>. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer&rsquo;s psionic blast deal psychic damage.</p><p><em><strong>Radiant</strong></em>. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric&rsquo;s <em>flame strike</em> spell or an angel&rsquo;s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</p><p><em><strong>Slashing</strong></em>. Swords, axes, and monsters&rsquo; claws deal slashing damage.</p><p><em><strong>Thunder</strong></em>. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the <em>thunderwave</em> spell, deals thunder damage.</p><h3 id=damage-resistance-and-vulnerability>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
<a class=anchor href=#damage-resistance-and-vulnerability>#</a></h3><p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p><p>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p><p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p><p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p><h3 id=healing>Healing
<a class=anchor href=#healing>#</a></h3><p>Unless it results in death, damage isn&rsquo;t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature&rsquo;s hit points, and magical methods such as a <em>cure wounds</em> spell or a <em>potion of healing</em> can remove damage in an instant.</p><p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature&rsquo;s hit points can&rsquo;t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p>A creature that has died can&rsquo;t regain hit points until magic such as the <em>revivify</em> spell has restored it to life.</p><h3 id=dropping-to-0-hit-points>Dropping to 0 Hit Points
<a class=anchor href=#dropping-to-0-hit-points>#</a></h3><p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p><h3 id=instant-death>Instant Death
<a class=anchor href=#instant-death>#</a></h3><p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p><p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p><h3 id=falling-unconscious>Falling Unconscious
<a class=anchor href=#falling-unconscious>#</a></h3><p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix ##). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.</p><h3 id=death-saving-throws>Death Saving Throws
<a class=anchor href=#death-saving-throws>#</a></h3><p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p><p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p><p><em><strong>Rolling 1 or 20</strong></em>. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p><p><em><strong>Damage at 0 Hit Points</strong></em>. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.</p><h4 id=stabilizing-a-creature>Stabilizing a Creature
<a class=anchor href=#stabilizing-a-creature>#</a></h4><p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn&rsquo;t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p><p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p>A <strong>stable</strong> creature doesn&rsquo;t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn&rsquo;t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p><h3 id=monsters-and-death>Monsters and Death
<a class=anchor href=#monsters-and-death>#</a></h3><p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.</p><p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.</p><h2 id=knocking-a-creature-out>Knocking a Creature Out
<a class=anchor href=#knocking-a-creature-out>#</a></h2><p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.</p><h2 id=temporary-hit-points>Temporary Hit Points
<a class=anchor href=#temporary-hit-points>#</a></h2><p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren&rsquo;t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p><p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p><p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p><p>Healing can&rsquo;t restore temporary hit points, and they can&rsquo;t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p><p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn&rsquo;t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you&rsquo;re in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p><p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they&rsquo;re depleted or you finish a long rest.</p><h1 id=mounted-combat>Mounted Combat
<a class=anchor href=#mounted-combat>#</a></h1><p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p><p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p><h2 id=mounting-and-dismounting>Mounting and Dismounting
<a class=anchor href=#mounting-and-dismounting>#</a></h2><p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can&rsquo;t mount it if you don&rsquo;t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you&rsquo;re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you&rsquo;re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p><p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.</p><h2 id=controlling-a-mount>Controlling a Mount
<a class=anchor href=#controlling-a-mount>#</a></h2><p>While you&rsquo;re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p><p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p><p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p><p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you&rsquo;re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p><h1 id=underwater-combat>Underwater Combat
<a class=anchor href=#underwater-combat>#</a></h1><p>When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.</p><p>When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that doesn&rsquo;t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.</p><p>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon&rsquo;s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).</p><p>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.</p><h1 id=spellcasting-8>Spellcasting
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-8>#</a></h1><p>Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.</p><p>This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.</p><h1 id=what-is-a-spell>What Is a Spell?
<a class=anchor href=#what-is-a-spell>#</a></h1><p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.</p><p>Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix ##), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.</p><p>Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse&rsquo;s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p><h2 id=spell-level>Spell Level
<a class=anchor href=#spell-level>#</a></h2><p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell&rsquo;s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) <em>magic missile</em> at 1st level and the earth-shaking <em>wish</em> at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell&rsquo;s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p><p>Spell level and character level don&rsquo;t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p><h2 id=known-and-prepared-spells>Known and Prepared Spells
<a class=anchor href=#known-and-prepared-spells>#</a></h2><p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.</p><p>In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character&rsquo;s level.</p><h2 id=spell-slots-4>Spell Slots
<a class=anchor href=#spell-slots-4>#</a></h2><p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class&rsquo;s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.</p><p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell&rsquo;s level or higher, effectively &ldquo;filling&rdquo; a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts <em>magic missile</em>, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.</p><p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.</p><h3 id=casting-a-spell-at-a-higher-level>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
<a class=anchor href=#casting-a-spell-at-a-higher-level>#</a></h3><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts <em>magic missile</em> using one of her 2nd-level slots, that <em>magic missile</em> is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p>Some spells, such as <em>magic missile</em> and <em>cure wounds</em>, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell&rsquo;s description.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Casting in Armor</strong></p><p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p></blockquote><h1 id=cantrips-6>Cantrips
<a class=anchor href=#cantrips-6>#</a></h1><p>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster&rsquo;s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip&rsquo;s spell level is 0.</p><h1 id=rituals>Rituals
<a class=anchor href=#rituals>#</a></h1><p>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn&rsquo;t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can&rsquo;t be cast at a higher level.</p><p>To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character&rsquo;s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard&rsquo;s does.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The Schools of Magic</strong></em></p><p>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.</p><p>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.</p><p><strong>Abjuration</strong> spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.</p><p><strong>Conjuration</strong> spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster&rsquo;s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.</p><p><strong>Divination</strong> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.</p><p><strong>Enchantment</strong> spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.</p><p><strong>Evocation</strong> spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.</p><p><strong>Illusion</strong> spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</p><p><strong>Necromancy</strong> spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.</p><p>Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.</p><p><strong>Transmutation</strong> spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster&rsquo;s command, or enhance a creature&rsquo;s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</p></blockquote><h1 id=casting-a-spell>Casting a Spell
<a class=anchor href=#casting-a-spell>#</a></h1><p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character&rsquo;s class or the spell&rsquo;s effects.</p><p>Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell&rsquo;s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell&rsquo;s effect.</p><h2 id=casting-time>Casting Time
<a class=anchor href=#casting-time>#</a></h2><p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p><h3 id=bonus-action>Bonus Action
<a class=anchor href=#bonus-action>#</a></h3><p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven&rsquo;t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can&rsquo;t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</p><h3 id=reactions-1>Reactions
<a class=anchor href=#reactions-1>#</a></h3><p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p><h3 id=longer-casting-times>Longer Casting Times
<a class=anchor href=#longer-casting-times>#</a></h3><p>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see &ldquo;Concentration&rdquo; below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don&rsquo;t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</p><h2 id=spell-range>Spell Range
<a class=anchor href=#spell-range>#</a></h2><p>The target of a spell must be within the spell&rsquo;s range. For a spell like <em>magic missile</em>, the target is a creature. For a spell like <em>fireball</em>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p><p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the <em>shield</em> spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p><p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell&rsquo;s effect must be you (see &ldquo;Areas of Effect&rdquo; later in the this chapter).</p><p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren&rsquo;t limited by its range, unless the spell&rsquo;s description says otherwise.</p><h2 id=components>Components
<a class=anchor href=#components>#</a></h2><p>A spell&rsquo;s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell&rsquo;s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can&rsquo;t provide one or more of a spell&rsquo;s components, you are unable to cast the spell.</p><h3 id=verbal-v>Verbal (V)
<a class=anchor href=#verbal-v>#</a></h3><p>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren&rsquo;t the source of the spell&rsquo;s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the <em>silence</em> spell, can&rsquo;t cast a spell with a verbal component.</p><h3 id=somatic-s>Somatic (S)
<a class=anchor href=#somatic-s>#</a></h3><p>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.</p><h3 id=material-m>Material (M)
<a class=anchor href=#material-m>#</a></h3><p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a <strong>component pouch</strong> or a <strong>spellcasting focus</strong> (found in &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p><p>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.</p><p>A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell&rsquo;s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p><h2 id=duration>Duration
<a class=anchor href=#duration>#</a></h2><p>A spell&rsquo;s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p><h3 id=instantaneous>Instantaneous
<a class=anchor href=#instantaneous>#</a></h3><p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can&rsquo;t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.</p><h3 id=concentration>Concentration
<a class=anchor href=#concentration>#</a></h3><p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p><p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p><p>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn&rsquo;t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p><ul><li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can&rsquo;t concentrate on two spells at once.</li><li><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon&rsquo;s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li><li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li></ul><p>The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you&rsquo;re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</p><h2 id=targets>Targets
<a class=anchor href=#targets>#</a></h2><p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell&rsquo;s magic. A spell&rsquo;s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).</p><p>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature&rsquo;s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.</p><h3 id=a-clear-path-to-the-target>A Clear Path to the Target
<a class=anchor href=#a-clear-path-to-the-target>#</a></h3><p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can&rsquo;t be behind total cover.</p><p>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can&rsquo;t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.</p><h3 id=targeting-yourself>Targeting Yourself
<a class=anchor href=#targeting-yourself>#</a></h3><p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.</p><h2 id=areas-of-effect>Areas of Effect
<a class=anchor href=#areas-of-effect>#</a></h2><p>Spells such as <em>burning hands</em> and <em>cone of cold</em> cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.</p><p>A spell&rsquo;s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a <strong>point of origin</strong>, a location from which the spell&rsquo;s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p><p>A spell&rsquo;s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn&rsquo;t included in the spell&rsquo;s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.</p><h3 id=cone>Cone
<a class=anchor href=#cone>#</a></h3><p>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone&rsquo;s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point&rsquo;s distance from the point of origin. A cone&rsquo;s area of effect specifies its maximum length.</p><p>A cone&rsquo;s point of origin is not included in the cone&rsquo;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p><h3 id=cube>Cube
<a class=anchor href=#cube>#</a></h3><p>You select a cube&rsquo;s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube&rsquo;s size is expressed as the length of each side.</p><p>A cube&rsquo;s point of origin is not included in the cube&rsquo;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p><h3 id=cylinder>Cylinder
<a class=anchor href=#cylinder>#</a></h3><p>A cylinder&rsquo;s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell&rsquo;s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.</p><p>A cylinder&rsquo;s point of origin is included in the cylinder&rsquo;s area of effect.</p><h3 id=line>Line
<a class=anchor href=#line>#</a></h3><p>A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.</p><p>A line&rsquo;s point of origin is not included in the line&rsquo;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p><h3 id=sphere>Sphere
<a class=anchor href=#sphere>#</a></h3><p>You select a sphere&rsquo;s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere&rsquo;s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.</p><p>A sphere&rsquo;s point of origin is included in the sphere&rsquo;s area of effect.</p><h1 id=spell-saving-throws>Spell Saving Throws
<a class=anchor href=#spell-saving-throws>#</a></h1><p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell&rsquo;s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p><p>The DC to resist one of your spells = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p><h1 id=spell-attack-rolls>Spell Attack Rolls
<a class=anchor href=#spell-attack-rolls>#</a></h1><p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn&rsquo;t incapacitated.</p><h1 id=combining-magical-effects>Combining Magical Effects
<a class=anchor href=#combining-magical-effects>#</a></h1><p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don&rsquo;t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap.</p><p>For example, if two clerics cast <em>bless</em> on the same target, that character gains the spell&rsquo;s benefit only once; he or she doesn&rsquo;t get to roll two bonus dice.</p><h1 id=spells>Spells

You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can&rsquo;t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you&rsquo;re bipedal, you can&rsquo;t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.</p><p><em><strong>Natural Weapons</strong></em>.

Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.</p><p>The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target&rsquo;s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce the creature&rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&rsquo;t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&rsquo;t speak or cast spells.</p><p>The target&rsquo;s gear melds into the new form.

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature&rsquo;s game statistics).</p><p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><p>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you&rsquo;ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd.

Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.

If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.</p><p>If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

The barrier lasts for the duration.</p><p>The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.</p><p>If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.</p><h4 id=antimagic-field>Antimagic Field
<a class=anchor href=#antimagic-field>#</a></h4><p><em>8th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (10-foot radius sphere)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>A 10-foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can&rsquo;t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p><p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can&rsquo;t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn&rsquo;t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p><p><em><strong>Targeted Effects</strong></em>. Spells and other magical effects, such as <em>magic missile</em> and <em>charm person</em>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p><p><em><strong>Areas of Magic</strong></em>. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <em>fireball</em>, can&rsquo;t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <em>wall of fire</em> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p><p><em><strong>Spells</strong></em>. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p><p><em><strong>Magic Items</strong></em>. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a <em>+1 longsword</em> in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p><p>A magic weapon&rsquo;s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p><p><em><strong>Magical Travel</strong></em>. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the <em>rope trick</em> spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p><p><em><strong>Creatures and Objects</strong></em>. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p><p><em><strong>Dispel Magic</strong></em>. Spells and magical effects such as <em>dispel magic</em> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different <em>antimagic field</em> spells don&rsquo;t nullify each other.</p><h4 id=antipathysympathy>Antipathy/Sympathy
<a class=anchor href=#antipathysympathy>#</a></h4><p><em>8th-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the <em>antipathy</em> effect or a drop of honey for the <em>sympathy</em> effect)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p><p>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura&rsquo;s effect.</p><p><em><strong>Antipathy</strong></em>. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can&rsquo;t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can&rsquo;t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.</p><p><em><strong>Sympathy</strong></em>. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can&rsquo;t willingly move away from the target.</p><p>If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.</p><p><em><strong>Ending the Effect</strong></em>. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</p><p>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p><h4 id=arcane-eye>Arcane Eye
<a class=anchor href=#arcane-eye>#</a></h4><p><em>4th-level divination</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.</p><p>You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.</p><p>As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can&rsquo;t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye&rsquo;s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.</p><h4 id=arcane-hand>Arcane Hand

The hand lasts for the spell&rsquo;s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.</p><p>The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn&rsquo;t fill its space.</p><p>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.</p><p><em><strong>Clenched Fist</strong></em>. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p><p><em><strong>Forceful Hand</strong></em>. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.</p><p>Make a check with the hand&rsquo;s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p><p><em><strong>Grasping Hand</strong></em>. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand&rsquo;s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Interposing Hand</strong></em>. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can&rsquo;t move through the hand&rsquo;s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand&rsquo;s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand&rsquo;s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand&rsquo;s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn&rsquo;t need food or air and doesn&rsquo;t age.</p><p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.</p><p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</p><p>The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p><p>The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful <em>dispel magic</em> spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature&rsquo;s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature&rsquo;s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p><p>If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p><h4 id=augury>Augury

If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human&rsquo;s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.</p><p>The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature&rsquo;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can&rsquo;t see.

Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.</p><p>A creature inside the cage can&rsquo;t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage.

This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.</p><p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling&rsquo;s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn&rsquo;t already shattered, it explodes.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don&rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Explosive Runes</strong></em>.

The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can&rsquo;t move or be moved by any means until then.</p><p>The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</p><p><em><strong>Hedged Prison</strong></em>. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.</p><p>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p><p><em><strong>Minimus Containment</strong></em>. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can&rsquo;t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.</p><p>The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p><p><em><strong>Slumber</strong></em>. The target falls asleep and can&rsquo;t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.</p><p><em><strong>Ending the Spell</strong></em>. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature&rsquo;s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.</p><p>A <em>dispel magic</em> spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p><p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.</p><h4 id=incendiary-cloud>Incendiary Cloud

You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can&rsquo;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can&rsquo;t leave it.

As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

Creatures that can&rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.</p><p>Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p><p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.

Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.</p><p>While merged with the stone, you can&rsquo;t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage.

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.</p><p>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&rsquo;s voice, a lion&rsquo;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p><p>If you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&rsquo;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p><p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The terrain&rsquo;s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.</p><p>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn&rsquo;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.</p><p>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell&rsquo;s area disappears immediately.</p><p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain&rsquo;s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion&rsquo;s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.</p><h4 id=mirror-image>Mirror Image

Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it&rsquo;s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.</p><p>Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell&rsquo;s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.</p><p>If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack&rsquo;s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.</p><p>A duplicate&rsquo;s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.</p><p>A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can&rsquo;t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.</p><h4 id=mislead>Mislead

The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.</p><p>You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.</p><p>You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again.

One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target&rsquo;s memories are modified.</p><p>While this charm lasts, you can affect the target&rsquo;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p><p>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature&rsquo;s memory isn&rsquo;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p><p>A modified memory doesn&rsquo;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature&rsquo;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p><p>A <em>remove curse</em> or <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the target restores the creature&rsquo;s true memory.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target&rsquo;s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature&rsquo;s past (9th level).</p><h4 id=moonbeam>Moonbeam

Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p><p>When a creature enters the spell&rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can&rsquo;t assume a different form until it leaves the spell&rsquo;s light.</p><p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area&rsquo;s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can&rsquo;t exceed half the area&rsquo;s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square&rsquo;s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.</p><p>At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.</p><p>Because the terrain&rsquo;s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can&rsquo;t usually be trapped or injured by the ground&rsquo;s movement.</p><p>This spell can&rsquo;t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.</p><p>Similarly, this spell doesn&rsquo;t directly affect plant growth.

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature&rsquo;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM&rsquo;s choice).</p><p>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn&rsquo;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p><p>Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature&rsquo;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p><p>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature&rsquo;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p><p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p><h4 id=planar-binding>Planar Binding

The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted <em>magic circle</em> in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell&rsquo;s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.</p><p>A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence.

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p><p>Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.</p><p>You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw.

The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p><p>Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.</p><p>The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&rsquo;t change a target&rsquo;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.</p><p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature&rsquo;s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature&rsquo;s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p><p>A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.</p><h4 id=sending>Sending

The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.</p><p>You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn&rsquo;t arrive.</p><h4 id=sequester>Sequester

When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can&rsquo;t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn&rsquo;t grow older.</p><p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include &ldquo;after 1,000 years&rdquo; or &ldquo;when the tarrasque awakens.&rdquo; This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.</p><h4 id=shapechange>Shapechange

The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can&rsquo;t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.</p><p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature&rsquo;s bonus in place of yours. You can&rsquo;t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.</p><p>You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&rsquo;t knocked unconscious.</p><p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can&rsquo;t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.</p><p>When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.</p><p>During this spell&rsquo;s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.</p><h4 id=shatter>Shatter

Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>A nonmagical object that isn&rsquo;t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it&rsquo;s in the spell&rsquo;s area.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon&rsquo;s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn&rsquo;t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.</p><h4 id=shocking-grasp>Shocking Grasp

The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn&rsquo;t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.</p><p>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature&rsquo;s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.</p><p>The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.</p><p>If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.</p><p>If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.</p><h4 id=sleep>Sleep

On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature&rsquo;s abilities or magic items, it can&rsquo;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p><p>If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn&rsquo;t take effect until the creature&rsquo;s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell.

The corpse must still have a mouth and can&rsquo;t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn&rsquo;t return the creature&rsquo;s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can&rsquo;t learn new information, doesn&rsquo;t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can&rsquo;t speculate about future events.</p><h4 id=speak-with-plants>Speak with Plants

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature&rsquo;s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers).

During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p><p><em><strong>Fear</strong></em>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.</p><p><em><strong>Hopelessness</strong></em>. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can&rsquo;t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.</p><p><em><strong>Insanity</strong></em>. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can&rsquo;t take actions, can&rsquo;t understand what other creatures say, can&rsquo;t read, and speaks only in gibberish.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy&rsquo;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><em><strong>On Target</strong></em>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><em><strong>Off Target</strong></em>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><em><strong>Similar Area</strong></em>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that&rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard&rsquo;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><em><strong>Mishap</strong></em>. The spell&rsquo;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p><h4 id=teleportation-circle>Teleportation Circle

Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern.

On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p><p>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&rsquo;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn&rsquo;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p><p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</p><p>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.

While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can&rsquo;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.</p><p>If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don&rsquo;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><ul><li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn&rsquo;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li><li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the <em>greater restoration</em> spell.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich&rsquo;s life drain attack.</li><li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>wish</em> spell could undo an opponent&rsquo;s successful save, a foe&rsquo;s critical hit, or a friend&rsquo;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li></ul><p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item&rsquo;s current owner.</p><p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can&rsquo;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn&rsquo;t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <em>wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p><h4 id=word-of-recall>Word of Recall

Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.</p><p>Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.</p><h2 id=the-material-plane>The Material Plane
<a class=anchor href=#the-material-plane>#</a></h2><p>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.</p><p>The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.</p><h2 id=beyond-the-material>Beyond the Material
<a class=anchor href=#beyond-the-material>#</a></h2><p>Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery.

<a class=anchor href=#planar-travel>#</a></h3><p>When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.</p><p>Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.</p><p><em><strong>Spells</strong></em>. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. <em>Plane shift</em> and <em>gate</em> can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. <em>Etherealness</em> allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the <em>astral projection</em> spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.</p><p><em><strong>Portals</strong></em>. A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</p><h3 id=transitive-planes>Transitive Planes
<a class=anchor href=#transitive-planes>#</a></h3><p>The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as <em>etherealness</em> and <em>astral projection</em> allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.</p><p>The <strong>Ethereal Plane</strong> is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the <em>see invisibility</em> and <em>true seeing</em> spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as <em>forcecage</em> and <em>wall of force</em>. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.</p><p>The <strong>Astral Plane</strong> is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p><h3 id=inner-planes>Inner Planes
<a class=anchor href=#inner-planes>#</a></h3><p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four <strong>Elemental Planes</strong> - Air, Earth, Fire, and Water - form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning <strong>Elemental Chaos</strong>.</p><p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.</p><h3 id=outer-planes>Outer Planes
<a class=anchor href=#outer-planes>#</a></h3><p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p><p>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally &ldquo;places&rdquo; at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p><p>Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.</p><p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p><p>The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.</p><h4 id=outer-planes-1>Outer Planes
<a class=anchor href=#outer-planes-1>#</a></h4><p>The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the <strong>Upper Planes</strong>. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the <strong>Lower Planes</strong>. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane&rsquo;s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn&rsquo;t match the plane&rsquo;s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p><h4 id=demiplanes>Demiplanes
<a class=anchor href=#demiplanes>#</a></h4><p>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don&rsquo;t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as <em>demiplane</em>, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a <em>plane shift</em> spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The <em>gate</em> spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p><h1 id=situational-rules>Situational Rules
<a class=anchor href=#situational-rules>#</a></h1><h2 id=traps>Traps
<a class=anchor href=#traps>#</a></h2><p>Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.</p><p>A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. <strong>Mechanical traps</strong> include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. <strong>Magic traps</strong> are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as <em>glyph of warding</em> and <em>symbol</em> that function as traps.</p><h3 id=traps-in-play>Traps in Play
<a class=anchor href=#traps-in-play>#</a></h3><p>When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.</p><h4 id=triggering-a-trap>Triggering a Trap
<a class=anchor href=#triggering-a-trap>#</a></h4><p>Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap&rsquo;s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the <em>glyph of warding</em> spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.</p><h4 id=detecting-and-disabling-a-trap>Detecting and Disabling a Trap
<a class=anchor href=#detecting-and-disabling-a-trap>#</a></h4><p>Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>A trap&rsquo;s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap&rsquo;s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap&rsquo;s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, <em>dispel magic</em> has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap&rsquo;s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel magic</em>.</p><p>In most cases, a trap&rsquo;s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character&rsquo;s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn&rsquo;t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap&rsquo;s description to determine what happens. No trap&rsquo;s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap&rsquo;s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it&rsquo;s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p><h4 id=trap-effects>Trap Effects
<a class=anchor href=#trap-effects>#</a></h4><p>The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap&rsquo;s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.</p><p>The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap&rsquo;s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.</p><p>A trap intended to be a <strong>setback</strong> is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a <strong>dangerous</strong> trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A <strong>deadly</strong> trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.</p><p><strong>Table- Trap Dangers</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Trap Danger</th><th>Save DC</th><th>Attack Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Setback</td><td>10-11</td><td>+3 to +5</td></tr><tr><td>Dangerous</td><td>12-15</td><td>+6 to +8</td></tr><tr><td>Deadly</td><td>16-20</td><td>+9 to +12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table- Trap Severity</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Character Level</th><th>Setback</th><th>Dangerous</th><th>Deadly</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st-4th</td><td>1d10</td><td>2d10</td><td>4d10</td></tr><tr><td>5th-10th</td><td>2d10</td><td>4d10</td><td>10d10</td></tr><tr><td>11th-16th</td><td>4d10</td><td>10d10</td><td>18d10</td></tr><tr><td>17th-20th</td><td>10d10</td><td>18d10</td><td>24d10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=complex-traps>Complex Traps
<a class=anchor href=#complex-traps>#</a></h4><p>Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.</p><p>When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap&rsquo;s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.</p><p>For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap&rsquo;s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.</p><h3 id=sample-traps>Sample Traps
<a class=anchor href=#sample-traps>#</a></h3><p>The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.</p><h4 id=collapsing-roof>Collapsing Roof
<a class=anchor href=#collapsing-roof>#</a></h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.</p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves&rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p><p>Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.</p><p>The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it&rsquo;s in danger of collapse.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.</p><h4 id=falling-net>Falling Net
<a class=anchor href=#falling-net>#</a></h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.</p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves&rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10</p><p>Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.</p><h4 id=fire-breathing-statue>Fire-Breathing Statue
<a class=anchor href=#fire-breathing-statue>#</a></h4><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.</p><p>The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as <em>detect magic</em>, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.</p><p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful <em>dispel magic</em> (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.</p><h4 id=pits>Pits
<a class=anchor href=#pits>#</a></h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>Four basic pit traps are presented here.</p><p><em><strong>Simple Pit</strong></em>. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit&rsquo;s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.</p><p>The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit&rsquo;s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).</p><p><em><strong>Hidden Pit</strong></em>. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit&rsquo;s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.</p><p>When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.</p><p>Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit&rsquo;s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the <em>arcane lock</em> spell or similar magic.</p><p><em><strong>Locking Pit</strong></em>. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.</p><p>A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.</p><p><em><strong>Spiked Pit</strong></em>. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h4 id=poison-darts>Poison Darts
<a class=anchor href=#poison-darts>#</a></h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.</p><p>The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.</p><p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8</p><p>bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don&rsquo;t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h4 id=poison-needle>Poison Needle
<a class=anchor href=#poison-needle>#</a></h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest&rsquo;s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.</p><p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap&rsquo;s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.</p><h4 id=rolling-sphere>Rolling Sphere
<a class=anchor href=#rolling-sphere>#</a></h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap&rsquo;s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.</p><p>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate&rsquo;s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.</p><p>Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures&rsquo; spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature&rsquo;s space or a creature enters its space while it&rsquo;s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p><p>The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can&rsquo;t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.</p><p>As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere&rsquo;s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere&rsquo;s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.</p><h4 id=sphere-of-annihilation>Sphere of Annihilation
<a class=anchor href=#sphere-of-annihilation>#</a></h4><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.</p><p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a <em>sphere of annihilation</em> that can&rsquo;t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal <em>sphere of annihilation</em>.</p><p>Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the sympathy aspect of the <em>antipathy/sympathy</em> spell. A successful <em>dispel magic</em> (DC 18) removes this enchantment.</p><h2 id=diseases>Diseases
<a class=anchor href=#diseases>#</a></h2><p>A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.</p><p>A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of <em>lesser restoration</em>. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.</p><p>A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren&rsquo;t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.</p><h3 id=sample-diseases>Sample Diseases
<a class=anchor href=#sample-diseases>#</a></h3><p>The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.</p><h4 id=cackle-fever>Cackle Fever
<a class=anchor href=#cackle-fever>#</a></h4><p>This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: &ldquo;the shrieks.&rdquo;</p><p>Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can&rsquo;t be removed until the disease is cured.</p><p>Any event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.</p><p>Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.</p><p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.</p><h4 id=sewer-plague>Sewer Plague
<a class=anchor href=#sewer-plague>#</a></h4><p>Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.</p><p>When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.</p><p>It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague&rsquo;s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.</p><p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character&rsquo;s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature&rsquo;s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.</p><h4 id=sight-rot>Sight Rot
<a class=anchor href=#sight-rot>#</a></h4><p>This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.</p><p>A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature&rsquo;s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as <em>lesser restoration</em> or <em>heal</em>.</p><p>Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.</p><h2 id=madness>Madness
<a class=anchor href=#madness>#</a></h2><p>In a typical campaign, characters aren&rsquo;t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.</p><h3 id=going-mad>Going Mad
<a class=anchor href=#going-mad>#</a></h3><p>Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as <em>contact other plane</em> and <em>symbol</em>, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.</p><p>Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.</p><h3 id=madness-effects>Madness Effects
<a class=anchor href=#madness-effects>#</a></h3><p>Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.</p><p>A character afflicted with <strong>short-term madness</strong> is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.</p><p>A character afflicted with <strong>long-term madness</strong> is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.</p><p>A character afflicted with <strong>indefinite madness</strong> gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.</p><p><strong>Table- Madness Short-Term Effects</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01-20</td><td>The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed.

<a class=anchor href=#curing-madness>#</a></h3><p>A <em>calm emotions</em> spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a <em>lesser restoration</em> spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, <em>remove curse</em> or <em>dispel evil</em> might also prove effective. A <em>greater restoration</em> spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.</p><h2 id=objects>Objects
<a class=anchor href=#objects>#</a></h2><p>When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire&rsquo;s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character&rsquo;s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.</p><p>For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.</p><h3 id=statistics-for-objects>Statistics for Objects
<a class=anchor href=#statistics-for-objects>#</a></h3><p>When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.</p><p><em><strong>Armor Class</strong></em>. An object&rsquo;s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.</p><p><strong>Table- Object&rsquo;s Armor Class</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Substance</th><th>AC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cloth, paper, rope</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Crystal, glass, ice</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Wood, bone</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Stone</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Iron, steel</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Mithral</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Adamantine</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Hit Points</strong></em>. An object&rsquo;s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.</p><p><strong>Table- Object&rsquo;s Hit Points</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Fragile</th><th>Resilient</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tiny (bottle, lock)</td><td>2 (1d4)</td><td>5 (2d4)</td></tr><tr><td>Small (chest, lute)</td><td>3 (1d6)</td><td>10 (3d6)</td></tr><tr><td>Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td><td>4 (1d8)</td><td>18 (4d8)</td></tr><tr><td>Large (cart, 10-ft-by-10-ft window)</td><td>5 (1d10)</td><td>27 (5d10)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Huge and Gargantuan Objects</strong></em>. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an <em>earthquake</em> spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object&rsquo;s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section&rsquo;s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Objects and Damage Types</strong></em>. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can&rsquo;t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.</p><p><em><strong>Damage Threshold</strong></em>. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object&rsquo;s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn&rsquo;t reduce the object&rsquo;s hit points.</p><h2 id=poisons>Poisons
<a class=anchor href=#poisons>#</a></h2><p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.</p><p>Poisons come in the following four types.</p><p><em><strong>Contact</strong></em>. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p><p><em><strong>Ingested</strong></em>. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p><p><em><strong>Inhaled</strong></em>. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one&rsquo;s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p><p><em><strong>Injury</strong></em>. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p><p><strong>Table- List of Poisons</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Type</th><th>Price/Dose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assassin&rsquo;s blood</td><td>Ingested</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Burnt othur fumes</td><td>Inhaled</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Crawler mucus</td><td>Contact</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Drow poison</td><td>Injury</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Essence of ether</td><td>Inhaled</td><td>300 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Malice</td><td>Inhaled</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Midnight tears</td><td>Ingested</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Oil of taggit</td><td>Contact</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Pale tincture</td><td>Ingested</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Purple worm poison</td><td>Injury</td><td>2,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Serpent venom</td><td>Injury</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Torpor</td><td>Ingested</td><td>600 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Truth serum</td><td>Ingested</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Wyvern poison</td><td>Injury</td><td>1,200 gp</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=sample-poisons>Sample Poisons

Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof.

<a class=anchor href=#marvelous-pigments>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.</p><p>Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons - that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p><p>When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.</p><p>Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p><p>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.</p><h3 id=medallion-of-thoughts>Medallion of Thoughts

The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.</p><p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror&rsquo;s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror&rsquo;s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p><p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror&rsquo;s cells don&rsquo;t age, and they don&rsquo;t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p><p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p><p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror&rsquo;s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.</p><p>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror.

Any creature inside an open <em>portable hole</em> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</p><p>You can use an action to close a <em>portable hole</em> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what&rsquo;s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p><p>If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole&rsquo;s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check.

If its wielder refuses to comply with the item&rsquo;s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:</li><li>Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.</li><li>Suppress one or more of its activated properties.</li><li>Attempt to take control of its wielder.</li></ul><p>If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12+the item&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item&rsquo;s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can&rsquo;t use this power again until the next dawn.</p><h1 id=artifacts>Artifacts
<a class=anchor href=#artifacts>#</a></h1><h3 id=orb-of-dragonkind>Orb of Dragonkind
<a class=anchor href=#orb-of-dragonkind>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p><p>Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five <em>Orbs of Dragonkind</em> (or <em>Dragon Orbs</em>) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p><p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p><p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p><p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p><p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb&rsquo;s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p><p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can&rsquo;t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts <em>suggestion</em> on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p><p><em><strong>Random Properties</strong></em>. An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the following random properties:</p><ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li><li>1 major detrimental property</li></ul><p><em><strong>Spells</strong></em>. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <em>cure wounds</em> (5th-level version, 3 charges), <em>daylight</em> (1 charge), <em>death ward</em> (2 charges), or <em>scrying</em> (3 charges).</p><p>You can also use an action to cast the <em>detect magic</em> spell from the orb without using any charges.</p><p><em><strong>Call Dragons</strong></em>. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can&rsquo;t be used again for 1 hour.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying an Orb</strong></em>. An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A <em>disintegrate</em> spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</p><h1 id=monsters>Monsters
<a class=anchor href=#monsters>#</a></h1><h1 id=monster-statistics>Monster Statistics
<a class=anchor href=#monster-statistics>#</a></h1><h2 id=type>Type
<a class=anchor href=#type>#</a></h2><p>A monster&rsquo;s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an <em>arrow of dragon slaying</em> deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.</p><p>The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.</p><p><strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature&rsquo;s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.</p><p><strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.</p><p><strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.</p><p><strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</p><p><strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.</p><p><strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.</p><p><strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</p><p><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.</p><p><strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.</p><p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p><p><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don&rsquo;t fit into any other type.</p><p><strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.</p><p><strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.</p><p><strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.</p><h4 id=tags>Tags
<a class=anchor href=#tags>#</a></h4><p>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the <em>humanoid (orc)</em> type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.</p><h2 id=alignment-3>Alignment
<a class=anchor href=#alignment-3>#</a></h2><p>A monster&rsquo;s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em> for descriptions of the different alignments.</p><p>The alignment specified in a monster&rsquo;s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster&rsquo;s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you.</p><p>Some creatures can have <strong>any alignment</strong>. In other words, you choose the monster&rsquo;s alignment. Some monster&rsquo;s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.</p><p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don&rsquo;t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are <strong>unaligned</strong>, which means they don&rsquo;t have an alignment.</p><h2 id=armor-class-1>Armor Class
<a class=anchor href=#armor-class-1>#</a></h2><p>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster&rsquo;s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.</p><h2 id=hit-points-14>Hit Points
<a class=anchor href=#hit-points-14>#</a></h2><p>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p><p>A monster&rsquo;s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).</p><p>A monster&rsquo;s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p><p><strong>Table- Hit Dice by Size</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Monster Size</th><th>Hit Die</th><th>Average HP per Die</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>d4</td><td>2 1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>d6</td><td>3 1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>d8</td><td>4 1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>d10</td><td>5 1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>d12</td><td>6 1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>d20</td><td>10 1/2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A monster&rsquo;s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8+2 hit points (average 11).</p><h2 id=speed-2>Speed
<a class=anchor href=#speed-2>#</a></h2><p>A monster&rsquo;s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p><p>All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster&rsquo;s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.</p><p>Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.</p><h3 id=burrow>Burrow
<a class=anchor href=#burrow>#</a></h3><p>A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can&rsquo;t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.</p><h3 id=climb>Climb
<a class=anchor href=#climb>#</a></h3><p>A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn&rsquo;t need to spend extra movement to climb.</p><h3 id=fly-1>Fly
<a class=anchor href=#fly-1>#</a></h3><p>A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to <strong>hover</strong>, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.</p><h3 id=swim>Swim
<a class=anchor href=#swim>#</a></h3><p>A monster that has a swimming speed doesn&rsquo;t need to spend extra movement to swim.</p><h2 id=ability-scores>Ability Scores
<a class=anchor href=#ability-scores>#</a></h2><p>Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they&rsquo;re used in play, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p><h2 id=saving-throws-1>Saving Throws
<a class=anchor href=#saving-throws-1>#</a></h2><p>The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn&rsquo;t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don&rsquo;t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.</p><p>A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster&rsquo;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster&rsquo;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).</p><p><strong>Table- Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Challenge</th><th>Proficiency Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>1/8</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>1/4</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>1/2</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>+9</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>+9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=skills-1>Skills
<a class=anchor href=#skills-1>#</a></h2><p>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster&rsquo;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster&rsquo;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.</p><p><em><strong>Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies</strong></em></p><p><em>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.</em></p><p><em>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.</em></p><p><em>See the Player&rsquo;s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.</em></p><h2 id=vulnerabilities-resistances-and-immunities>Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
<a class=anchor href=#vulnerabilities-resistances-and-immunities>#</a></h2><p>Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.</p><h2 id=senses-1>Senses
<a class=anchor href=#senses-1>#</a></h2><p>The Senses entry notes a monster&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.</p><h3 id=blindsight-1>Blindsight
<a class=anchor href=#blindsight-1>#</a></h3><p>A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.</p><p>Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.</p><p>If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.</p><h3 id=darkvision-2>Darkvision
<a class=anchor href=#darkvision-2>#</a></h3><p>A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.</p><h3 id=tremorsense>Tremorsense
<a class=anchor href=#tremorsense>#</a></h3><p>A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can&rsquo;t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.</p><h3 id=truesight-1>Truesight
<a class=anchor href=#truesight-1>#</a></h3><p>A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.</p><h2 id=languages-3>Languages
<a class=anchor href=#languages-3>#</a></h2><p>The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can&rsquo;t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A &ldquo;-&rdquo; indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.</p><h3 id=telepathy>Telepathy
<a class=anchor href=#telepathy>#</a></h3><p>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn&rsquo;t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can&rsquo;t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.</p><p>A telepathic monster doesn&rsquo;t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can&rsquo;t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.</p><p>A creature within the area of an <em>antimagic field</em> or in any other location where magic doesn&rsquo;t function can&rsquo;t send or receive telepathic messages.</p><h2 id=challenge>Challenge
<a class=anchor href=#challenge>#</a></h2><p>A monster&rsquo;s <strong>Challenge rating</strong> tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.</p><p>Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.</p><p>Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.</p><h3 id=experience-points-1>Experience Points
<a class=anchor href=#experience-points-1>#</a></h3><p>The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.</p><p>Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.</p><p><strong>Table- Experience Points by Challenge Rating</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Challenge</th><th>XP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0 or 10</td></tr><tr><td>1/8</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>1/4</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>1/2</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1,100</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>2,300</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>2,900</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3,900</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>11,500</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>13,000</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>15,000</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>18,000</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>22,000</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>33,000</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>41,000</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>62,000</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>75,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=special-traits>Special Traits
<a class=anchor href=#special-traits>#</a></h2><p>Special traits (which appear after a monster&rsquo;s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.</p><h3 id=innate-spellcasting>Innate Spellcasting
<a class=anchor href=#innate-spellcasting>#</a></h3><p>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can&rsquo;t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster&rsquo;s challenge rating.</p><p>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the <em>levitate</em> spell, but the spell has a &ldquo;self only&rdquo; restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.</p><p>A monster&rsquo;s innate spells can&rsquo;t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster&rsquo;s innate spells don&rsquo;t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.</p><h3 id=spellcasting-9>Spellcasting
<a class=anchor href=#spellcasting-9>#</a></h3><p>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.</p><p>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.</p><p>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level <em>lightning bolt</em> spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.</p><h3 id=psionics>Psionics
<a class=anchor href=#psionics>#</a></h3><p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn&rsquo;t require any components to cast its spells.</p><h2 id=actions-1>Actions
<a class=anchor href=#actions-1>#</a></h2><p>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p><h3 id=melee-and-ranged-attacks>Melee and Ranged Attacks
<a class=anchor href=#melee-and-ranged-attacks>#</a></h3><p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Creature vs Target</strong></em>. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a &ldquo;target&rdquo; can be a creature or an object.</p><p><em><strong>Hit</strong></em>. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the &ldquo;Hit&rdquo; notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.</p><p><em><strong>Miss</strong></em>. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the &ldquo;Miss:&rdquo; notation.</p><p><em><strong>Grapple Rules for Monsters</strong></em></p><p><em>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn&rsquo;t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.</em></p><p><em>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster&rsquo;s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10+the monster&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) modifier.</em></p><h3 id=multiattack-1>Multiattack
<a class=anchor href=#multiattack-1>#</a></h3><p>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can&rsquo;t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.</p><h3 id=ammunition>Ammunition
<a class=anchor href=#ammunition>#</a></h3><p>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.</p><h2 id=reactions-2>Reactions
<a class=anchor href=#reactions-2>#</a></h2><p>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.</p><h2 id=limited-usage>Limited Usage
<a class=anchor href=#limited-usage>#</a></h2><p>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.</p><p><em><strong>X/Day</strong></em>. The notation &ldquo;X/Day&rdquo; means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, &ldquo;1/Day&rdquo; means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.</p><p><em><strong>Recharge X-Y</strong></em>. The notation &ldquo;Recharge X-Y&rdquo; means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster&rsquo;s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, &ldquo;Recharge 5-6&rdquo; means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster&rsquo;s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.</p><p><em><strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest</strong></em>. This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.</p><h2 id=equipment-14>Equipment
<a class=anchor href=#equipment-14>#</a></h2><p>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.</p><p>You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster&rsquo;s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.</p><p>If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.</p><h1 id=legendary-creatures>Legendary Creatures
<a class=anchor href=#legendary-creatures>#</a></h1><p>A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can&rsquo;t.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&rsquo;s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can&rsquo;t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can&rsquo;t use them until after its first turn in the combat.</p><h2 id=a-legendary-creatures-lair>A Legendary Creature&rsquo;s Lair
<a class=anchor href=#a-legendary-creatures-lair>#</a></h2><p>A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.</p><h3 id=lair-actions>Lair Actions
<a class=anchor href=#lair-actions>#</a></h3><p>If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair.

<a class=anchor href=#customizing-npcs>#</a></h1><p>There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.</p><p><em><strong>Racial Traits</strong></em>. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn&rsquo;t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Swaps</strong></em>. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC&rsquo;s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn&rsquo;t alter an NPC&rsquo;s challenge rating.</p><p><em><strong>Armor and Weapon Swaps</strong></em>. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC&rsquo;s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC&rsquo;s challenge rating.</p><p><em><strong>Magic Items</strong></em>. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.</p><h1 id=acolyte-1>Acolyte
