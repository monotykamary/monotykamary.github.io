This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn&rsquo;t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall.

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask&rsquo;s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you&rsquo;re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask.
