Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a 20-foot radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.
When a creature enters the spell&rsquo;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cone)
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)
Duration: 1 round
A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can&rsquo;t see).

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn&rsquo;t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn&rsquo;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.
<a href=/posts/references/spells/commune-with-nature/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/spells/commune/>Commune</a></h2><p>Commune # 5th-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)
Duration: 1 minute
You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.
Divine beings aren&rsquo;t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive &ldquo;unclear&rdquo; as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity&rsquo;s knowledge.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
Duration: 1 hour
For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.
<a href=/posts/references/spells/comprehend-languages/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/spells/compulsion/>Compulsion</a></h2><p>Compulsion # 4th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can&rsquo;t be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you.
<a href=/posts/references/spells/compulsion/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/spells/cone-of-cold/>Cone of Cold</a></h2><p>Cone of Cold # 5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (60-foot cone)
Components: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
Duration: Instantaneous
A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.
