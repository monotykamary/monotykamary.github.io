While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.
Curse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.

While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield&rsquo;s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield&rsquo;s normal bonus to AC.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/slippers-of-spider-climbing/>Slippers of Spider Climbing</a></h2><p>Slippers of Spider Climbing # Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don&rsquo;t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/sovereign-glue/>Sovereign Glue</a></h2><p>Sovereign Glue # Wondrous item, legendary
This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6+1 ounces.
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.

A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class&rsquo;s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell&rsquo;s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.
If the spell is on your class&rsquo;s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/sphere-of-annihilation/>Sphere of Annihilation</a></h2><p>Sphere of Annihilation # Wondrous item, legendary
This 2-foot diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn&rsquo;t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.
