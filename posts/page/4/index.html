Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.
A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration.
<a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/diseases/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/madness/>Madness</a></h2><p>Madness # In a typical campaign, characters aren&rsquo;t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.
<a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/madness/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/objects/>Objects</a></h2><p>Objects # When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire&rsquo;s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character&rsquo;s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.

They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.
The Celtic Pantheon # It&rsquo;s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell.

It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.
<a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/planes/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/poisons/>Poisons</a></h2><p>Poisons # Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.
Poisons come in the following four types.
Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects.
<a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/poisons/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/traps/>Traps</a></h2><p>Traps # Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.
<a href=/posts/references/gamemastering/traps/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/gameplay/abilities/>Abilities</a></h2><p>ABILITIES # Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature&rsquo;s physical and mental characteristics:
Strength, measuring physical power Dexterity, measuring agility Constitution, measuring endurance Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory Wisdom, measuring perception and insight Charisma, measuring force of personality Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature&rsquo;s assets as well as weaknesses.
The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores.

The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers&rsquo; movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.
