While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/necklace-of-fireballs/>Necklace of Fireballs</a></h2><p>Necklace of Fireballs # Wondrous item, rare
This necklace has 1d6+3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.

This necklace has 1d4+2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.
Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
The sword has 1d8+1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune).
<a href=/posts/references/treasure/nine-lives-stealer/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/oathbow/>Oathbow</a></h2><p>Oathbow # Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, &ldquo;Swift defeat to my enemies.&rdquo; When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, &ldquo;Swift death to you who have wronged me.&rdquo; The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time.

Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it&rsquo;s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/oil-of-slipperiness/>Oil of Slipperiness</a></h2><p>Oil of Slipperiness # Potion, uncommon
This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it&rsquo;s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/periapt-of-health/>Periapt of Health</a></h2><p>Periapt of Health # Wondrous item, uncommon
You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.</p></article><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/89/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/88/ aria-label="Page 88" class=page-link role=button>88</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/89/ aria-label="Page 89" class=page-link role=button>89</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 90" class=page-link role=button>90</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/91/ aria-label="Page 91" class=page-link role=button>91</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/92/ aria-label="Page 92" class=page-link role=button>92</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/91/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/102/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav><ul><li class=book-section-flat><strong>Categories</strong><ul></ul></li><li class=book-section-flat><strong>Tags</strong><ul></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
