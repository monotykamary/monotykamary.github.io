While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/necklace-of-fireballs/>Necklace of Fireballs</a></h2><p>Necklace of Fireballs # Wondrous item, rare
This necklace has 1d6+3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.

This necklace has 1d4+2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.
Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
The sword has 1d8+1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune).

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, &ldquo;Swift defeat to my enemies.&rdquo; When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, &ldquo;Swift death to you who have wronged me.&rdquo; The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time.
