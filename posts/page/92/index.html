When you drink this potion, you gain the &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion&rsquo;s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/potion-of-flying/>Potion of Flying</a></h2><p>Potion of Flying # Potion, very rare
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you&rsquo;re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion&rsquo;s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/potion-of-gaseous-form/>Potion of Gaseous Form</a></h2><p>Potion of Gaseous Form # Potion, rare
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion&rsquo;s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/potion-of-giant-strength/>Potion of Giant Strength</a></h2><p>Potion of Giant Strength # Potion, rarity varies
When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.
This potion&rsquo;s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.

When you drink this potion, you gain the &ldquo;enlarge&rdquo; effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion&rsquo;s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/potion-of-healing/>Potion of Healing</a></h2><p>Potion of Healing # Potion, rarity varies
You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion&rsquo;s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion&rsquo;s red liquid glimmers when agitated.

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration required).

This potion&rsquo;s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/potion-of-mind-reading/>Potion of Mind Reading</a></h2><p>Potion of Mind Reading # Potion, rare
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13). The potion&rsquo;s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/potion-of-poison/>Potion of Poison</a></h2><p>Potion of Poison # Potion, uncommon
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.
If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage.
