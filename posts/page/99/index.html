While this polished agate is on your person, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/sun-blade/>Sun Blade</a></h2><p>Sun Blade # Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)
This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the sun blade.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage.

When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, provided that the target isn&rsquo;t a construct or an undead. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/sword-of-sharpness/>Sword of Sharpness</a></h2><p>Sword of Sharpness # Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires attunement)
When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.
When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target&rsquo;s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM.

Hit points lost to this weapon&rsquo;s damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature&rsquo;s turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you&rsquo;ve wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success.

This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to control a sphere of annihilation while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a sphere of annihilation, you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your Intelligence modifier.
<a href=/posts/references/treasure/talisman-of-the-sphere/>...</a></p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/talisman-of-ultimate-evil/>Talisman of Ultimate Evil</a></h2><p>Talisman of Ultimate Evil # Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)
This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

This book contains memory and logic exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book&rsquo;s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Intelligence score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.</p></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/posts/references/treasure/tome-of-leadership-and-influence/>Tome of Leadership and Influence</a></h2><p>Tome of Leadership and Influence # Wondrous item, very rare

The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
