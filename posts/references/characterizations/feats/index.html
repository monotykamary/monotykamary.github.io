Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat&rsquo;s description says otherwise.</p><p>You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat&rsquo;s prerequisite, you can&rsquo;t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow-perhaps by a withering curse-you can&rsquo;t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.</p><h2 id=grappler>Grappler</h2><p><em>Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher</em></p><p>You&rsquo;ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.</li><li>You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.</li></ul><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
