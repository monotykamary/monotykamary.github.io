The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.</p><p>If the target is native to the plane of existence you&rsquo;re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p><p>If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you&rsquo;re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn&rsquo;t return.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.</li><li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li><li>While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.</li><li>While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.</li></ul><p>A <em>remove curse</em> spell ends this effect. At the GM&rsquo;s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse&rsquo;s effect.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn&rsquo;t require concentration.</p><h4 id=black-tentacles>Black Tentacles</h4><p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.</p><p>When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</p><p>A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.</p><h4 id=blade-barrier>Blade Barrier</h4><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p><p>If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.</p><p>If you target a nonmagical plant that isn&rsquo;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&rsquo;t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.

On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.</p><p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can&rsquo;t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren&rsquo;t there can&rsquo;t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.</p><h4 id=blur>Blur</h4><p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it&rsquo;s invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-­foot radius and can&rsquo;t become invisible until the spell ends.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>. When you cast this spell using a  spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h4 id=burning-hands>Burning Hands</h4><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot cone)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren&rsquo;t being worn or carried.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>.
