On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.</p><p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can&rsquo;t see anything there more than 60 feet away.

The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it&rsquo;s invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-­foot radius and can&rsquo;t become invisible until the spell ends.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels</strong></em>. When you cast this spell using a  spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h4 id=burning-hands>Burning Hands
