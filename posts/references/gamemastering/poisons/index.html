Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p><p><em><strong>Ingested</strong></em>. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p><p><em><strong>Inhaled</strong></em>. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one&rsquo;s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p><p><em><strong>Injury</strong></em>. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p><p><strong>Table- List of Poisons</strong></p><div class=table-wrapper><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Type</th><th>Price/Dose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assassin&rsquo;s blood</td><td>Ingested</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Burnt othur fumes</td><td>Inhaled</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Crawler mucus</td><td>Contact</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Drow poison</td><td>Injury</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Essence of ether</td><td>Inhaled</td><td>300 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Malice</td><td>Inhaled</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Midnight tears</td><td>Ingested</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Oil of taggit</td><td>Contact</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Pale tincture</td><td>Ingested</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Purple worm poison</td><td>Injury</td><td>2,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Serpent venom</td><td>Injury</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Torpor</td><td>Ingested</td><td>600 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Truth serum</td><td>Ingested</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Wyvern poison</td><td>Injury</td><td>1,200 gp</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id=sample-poisons>Sample Poisons</h2><p>Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.</p><p><em><strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Blood (Ingested)</strong></em>.
