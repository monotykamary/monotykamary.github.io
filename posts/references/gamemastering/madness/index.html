Certain spells, such as <em>contact other plane</em> and <em>symbol</em>, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.</p><p>Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.</p><h2 id=madness-effects>Madness Effects</h2><p>Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.</p><p>A character afflicted with <strong>short-term madness</strong> is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.</p><p>A character afflicted with <strong>long-term madness</strong> is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.</p><p>A character afflicted with <strong>indefinite madness</strong> gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.</p><p><strong>Table- Madness Short-Term Effects</strong></p><div class=table-wrapper><table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01-20</td><td>The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed.
