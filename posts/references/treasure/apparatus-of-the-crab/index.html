The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</p><p>The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:</p><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 20</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 200</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren&rsquo;t extended)</p><p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic</p><p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus&rsquo;s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p><p>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p><p>A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus&rsquo;s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p><p><strong>Table- Apparatus of the Crab</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Lever</th><th>Up</th><th>Down</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim.</td><td>Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus&rsquo;s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Forward window shutter opens.</td><td>Forward window shutter closes.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Side window shutters open (two per side).</td><td>Side window shutters close (two per side).</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.</td><td>The claws retract.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
