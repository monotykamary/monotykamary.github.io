It also has the following additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning</strong></em>. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.</p><p><em><strong>Thunder</strong></em>. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning Strike</strong></em>. You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff&rsquo;s tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><em><strong>Thunderclap</strong></em>. You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn&rsquo;t deafened.</p><p><em><strong>Thunder and Lightning</strong></em>. You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn&rsquo;t expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
