A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead&rsquo;s spell is cast, that bead can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><strong>Table- Necklace of Prayer Beads</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Bead of &mldr;</th><th>Spell</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-6</td><td>Blessing</td><td>Bless</td></tr><tr><td>7-12</td><td>Curing</td><td>Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration</td></tr><tr><td>13-16</td><td>Favor</td><td>Greater restoration</td></tr><tr><td>17-18</td><td>Smiting</td><td>Branding smite</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Summons</td><td>Planar ally</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Wind walking</td><td>Wind walk</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
