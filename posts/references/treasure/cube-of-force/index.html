Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p>You can use an action to press one of the cube&rsquo;s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube&rsquo;s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier&rsquo;s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.</p><p>If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can&rsquo;t pass through the cube, you can&rsquo;t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.</p><p><strong>Table- Cube of Force Effects</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Face</th><th>Charges</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Gases, wind, and fog can&rsquo;t pass through the barrier.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>Nonliving matter can&rsquo;t pass through the barrier.
