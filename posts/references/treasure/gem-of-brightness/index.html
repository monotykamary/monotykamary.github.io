This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:
The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn&rsquo;t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.118.2"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content><meta property="og:description" content="Gem of Brightness Wondrous item, uncommon
