Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.</p><p>If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell&rsquo;s save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn&rsquo;t already.</p><p>If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target.

If you didn&rsquo;t target a creature, you instead take 1d6 psychic damage.</td></tr><tr><td>26-30</td><td>You cast stinking cloud.</td></tr><tr><td>31-33</td><td>Heavy rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>34-36</td><td>An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal isn&rsquo;t under your control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears.

The area becomes heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>50-53</td><td>You enlarge the target as if you had cast enlarge/reduce. If the target can&rsquo;t be affected by that spell, or if you didn&rsquo;t target a creature, you become the target.</td></tr><tr><td>54-58</td><td>You cast darkness.</td></tr><tr><td>59-62</td><td>Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius centered on the target.

Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line.</td></tr><tr><td>91-95</td><td>A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</td></tr><tr><td>96-97</td><td>The target&rsquo;s skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected.</td></tr><tr><td>98-100</td><td>If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn&rsquo;t target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
