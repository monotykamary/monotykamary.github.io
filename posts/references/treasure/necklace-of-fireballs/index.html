This necklace has 1d6+3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.118.2"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content><meta property="og:description" content="Necklace of Fireballs Wondrous item, rare
