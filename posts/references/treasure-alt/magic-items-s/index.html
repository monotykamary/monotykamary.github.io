<a class=anchor href=#shield-of-missile-attraction>#</a></h3><p><em>Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.</p><p><em><strong>Curse</strong></em>. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the <em>remove curse</em> spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.</p><h3 id=slippers-of-spider-climbing>Slippers of Spider Climbing
<a class=anchor href=#slippers-of-spider-climbing>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

<a class=anchor href=#sovereign-glue>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p><p>This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with <em>oil of slipperiness</em>. When found, a container contains 1d6+1 ounces.</p><p>One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of <em>universal solvent</em> or <em>oil of etherealness</em>, or with a <em>wish</em> spell.</p><h3 id=spell-scroll>Spell Scroll
<a class=anchor href=#spell-scroll>#</a></h3><p><em>Scroll, varies</em></p><p>A <em>spell scroll</em> bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class&rsquo;s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell&rsquo;s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.</p><p>If the spell is on your class&rsquo;s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10+the spell&rsquo;s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.</p><p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll&rsquo;s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.</p><p><strong>Table- Spell Scroll</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Spell Level</th><th>Rarity</th><th>Save DC</th><th>Attack Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cantrip</td><td>Common</td><td>13</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>Common</td><td>13</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>13</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>15</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>Rare</td><td>15</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Rare</td><td>17</td><td>+9</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>Very rare</td><td>17</td><td>+9</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>Very rare</td><td>18</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>Very rare</td><td>18</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Legendary</td><td>19</td><td>+11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A wizard spell on a <em>spell scroll</em> can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10+the spell&rsquo;s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the <em>spell scroll</em> is destroyed.</p><h3 id=spellguard-shield>Spellguard Shield
<a class=anchor href=#spellguard-shield>#</a></h3><p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.</p><h3 id=sphere-of-annihilation>Sphere of Annihilation
<a class=anchor href=#sphere-of-annihilation>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p><p>This 2-foot diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p><p>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn&rsquo;t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.</p><p>The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.</p><p>If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature&rsquo;s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature&rsquo;s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.</p><p>If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the <em>gate</em> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a <em>portable hole</em>, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.</p><p><strong>Table- Sphere of Annihilation</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01-50</td><td>The sphere is destroyed.</td></tr><tr><td>51-85</td><td>The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.</td></tr><tr><td>86-00</td><td>A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=staff-of-charming>Staff of Charming

The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.</p><p>If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can&rsquo;t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff&rsquo;s intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.</p><p>The staff regains 1d8+2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.</p><h3 id=staff-of-fire>Staff of Fire

Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><em><strong>Thunderclap</strong></em>. You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute.

<a class=anchor href=#sun-blade>#</a></h3><p><em>Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the <em>sun blade</em>.</p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p><p>The sword&rsquo;s luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.</p><h3 id=sword-of-life-stealing>Sword of Life Stealing

Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target&rsquo;s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.</p><p>In addition, you can speak the sword&rsquo;s command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.</p><h3 id=sword-of-wounding>Sword of Wounding
<a class=anchor href=#sword-of-wounding>#</a></h3><p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>Hit points lost to this weapon&rsquo;s damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.</p><p>Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature&rsquo;s turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you&rsquo;ve wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#scarab-of-protection>Scarab of Protection</a></li><li><a href=#scimitar-of-speed>Scimitar of Speed</a></li><li><a href=#shield-1-2-or-3>Shield, +1, +2, or +3</a></li><li><a href=#shield-of-missile-attraction>Shield of Missile Attraction</a></li><li><a href=#slippers-of-spider-climbing>Slippers of Spider Climbing</a></li><li><a href=#sovereign-glue>Sovereign Glue</a></li><li><a href=#spell-scroll>Spell Scroll</a></li><li><a href=#spellguard-shield>Spellguard Shield</a></li><li><a href=#sphere-of-annihilation>Sphere of Annihilation</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-charming>Staff of Charming</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-fire>Staff of Fire</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-frost>Staff of Frost</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-healing>Staff of Healing</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-power>Staff of Power</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-striking>Staff of Striking</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-swarming-insects>Staff of Swarming Insects</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-the-magi>Staff of the Magi</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-the-python>Staff of the Python</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-the-woodlands>Staff of the Woodlands</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-thunder-and-lightning>Staff of Thunder and Lightning</a></li><li><a href=#staff-of-withering>Staff of Withering</a></li><li><a href=#stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals>Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals</a></li><li><a href=#stone-of-good-luck-luckstone>Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)</a></li><li><a href=#sun-blade>Sun Blade</a></li><li><a href=#sword-of-life-stealing>Sword of Life Stealing</a></li><li><a href=#sword-of-sharpness>Sword of Sharpness</a></li><li><a href=#sword-of-wounding>Sword of Wounding</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
