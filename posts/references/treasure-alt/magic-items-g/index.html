While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:</p><ul><li>The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn&rsquo;t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.</li><li>The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li><li>The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.</li></ul><p>When all of the gem&rsquo;s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.</p><h3 id=gem-of-seeing>Gem of Seeing</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This gem has 3 charges.

The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.</p><h3 id=gloves-of-missile-snaring>Gloves of Missile Snaring</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you&rsquo;re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10+your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.</p><h3 id=gloves-of-swimming-and-climbing>Gloves of Swimming and Climbing</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don&rsquo;t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.</p><h3 id=goggles-of-night>Goggles of Night</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
