Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.</p><p><strong>Table- Feather Token</strong></p><div class=table-wrapper><table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Feather Token</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01-20</td><td>Anchor</td></tr><tr><td>21-35</td><td>Bird</td></tr><tr><td>36-50</td><td>Fan</td></tr><tr><td>51-65</td><td>Swan boat</td></tr><tr><td>66-90</td><td>Tree</td></tr><tr><td>91-100</td><td>Whip</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><em><strong>Anchor</strong></em>. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can&rsquo;t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.</p><p><em><strong>Bird</strong></em>. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can&rsquo;t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p><p><em><strong>Fan</strong></em>. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.</p><p><em><strong>Swan Boat</strong></em>. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot long, 20-foot wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.</p><p><em><strong>Tree</strong></em>. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.</p><p><em><strong>Whip</strong></em>. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6+5 force damage.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.</p><h3 id=figurine-of-wondrous-power>Figurine of Wondrous Power</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rarity by figurine</em></p><p>A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn&rsquo;t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn&rsquo;t become a creature.</p><p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p><p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can&rsquo;t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine&rsquo;s description.</p><p><em><strong>Bronze Griffon (Rare)</strong></em>. This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 5 days have passed.</p><p><em><strong>Ebony Fly (Rare)</strong></em>. This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 2 days have passed.</p><h4 id=giant-fly>Giant Fly</h4><p><em>Large beast, unaligned</em></p><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 11</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 19 (3d10+3)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., fly 60 ft.</p><div class=table-wrapper><table><thead><tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>14 (+2)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>2 (-4)</td><td>10 (+0)</td><td>3 (-4)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> -</p><p><em><strong>Golden Lions (Rare)</strong></em>. These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p><p><em><strong>Ivory Goats (Rare)</strong></em>. These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p><ul><li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can&rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li><li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 30 days have passed.</li><li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can&rsquo;t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <em>+1 lance</em>, and the other becomes a <em>+2 longsword</em>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat&rsquo;s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 15 days have passed.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Marble Elephant (Rare)</strong></em>. This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p><p><em><strong>Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)</strong></em>. This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 5 days have passed.</p><p>If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p><p><em><strong>Onyx Dog (Rare)</strong></em>. This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p><p><em><strong>Serpentine Owl (Rare)</strong></em>. This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.</p><p><em><strong>Silver Raven (Uncommon)</strong></em>. This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can&rsquo;t be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the <em>animal messenger</em> spell on it at will.</p><h3 id=flame-tongue>Flame Tongue</h3><p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword&rsquo;s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.</p><h3 id=folding-boat>Folding Boat</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.</p><p>One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.</p><p>The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.</p><p>When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.</p><p>The third command word causes the <em>folding boat</em> to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can&rsquo;t fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.</p><h3 id=frost-brand>Frost Brand</h3><p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have resistance to fire damage.</p><p>In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</p><p>When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you. This property can be used no more than once per hour.</p></section><footer class=article-footer></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
