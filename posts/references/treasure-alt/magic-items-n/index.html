You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level <em>fireball</em> spell (save DC 15).</p><p>You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the <em>fireball</em> by 1 for each bead beyond the first.</p><h3 id=necklace-of-prayer-beads>Necklace of Prayer Beads</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</em></p><p>This necklace has 1d4+2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.</p><p>Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead&rsquo;s spell is cast, that bead can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><strong>Table- Necklace of Prayer Beads</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Bead of &mldr;</th><th>Spell</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-6</td><td>Blessing</td><td>Bless</td></tr><tr><td>7-12</td><td>Curing</td><td>Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration</td></tr><tr><td>13-16</td><td>Favor</td><td>Greater restoration</td></tr><tr><td>17-18</td><td>Smiting</td><td>Branding smite</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Summons</td><td>Planar ally</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Wind walking</td><td>Wind walk</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=nine-lives-stealer>Nine Lives Stealer</h3><p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>The sword has 1d8+1 charges.
