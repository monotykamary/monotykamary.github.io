<a class=anchor href=#magic-items-i>#</a></h1><h3 id=immovable-rod>Immovable Rod
<a class=anchor href=#immovable-rod>#</a></h3><p><em>Rod, uncommon</em></p><p>This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn&rsquo;t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.</p><h3 id=instant-fortress>Instant Fortress
<a class=anchor href=#instant-fortress>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.</p><p>The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the <em>knock</em> spell and similar magic, such as that of a <em>chime of opening</em>.</p><p>Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren&rsquo;t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.</p><p>The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,</p><p>immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a <em>wish</em> spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of <em>wish</em> causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.</p><h3 id=ioun-stone>Ioun Stone
<a class=anchor href=#ioun-stone>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)</em></p><p>An <em>Ioun stone</em> is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of <em>Ioun stone</em> exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.</p><p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p><p>A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Absorption (Very Rare)</strong></em>. While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.</p><p>Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can&rsquo;t cancel it.</p><p><em><strong>Agility (Very Rare)</strong></em>. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Awareness (Rare)</strong></em>. You can&rsquo;t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Fortitude (Very Rare)</strong></em>. Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Greater Absorption (Legendary)</strong></em>. While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.</p><p>Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can&rsquo;t cancel it.</p><p><em><strong>Insight (Very Rare)</strong></em>. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Intellect (Very Rare)</strong></em>. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Leadership (Very Rare)</strong></em>. Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Mastery (Legendary)</strong></em>. Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Protection (Rare)</strong></em>. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Regeneration (Legendary)</strong></em>. You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.</p><p><em><strong>Reserve (Rare)</strong></em>. This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p><p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can&rsquo;t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p><p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p><p><em><strong>Strength (Very Rare)</strong></em>. Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p><p><em><strong>Sustenance (Rare)</strong></em>. You don&rsquo;t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.</p><h3 id=iron-bands-of-binding>Iron Bands of Binding
<a class=anchor href=#iron-bands-of-binding>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.</p><p>Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.</p><p>A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.</p><p>Once the bands are used, they can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p><h3 id=iron-flask>Iron Flask
<a class=anchor href=#iron-flask>#</a></h3><p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p><p>This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask&rsquo;s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you&rsquo;re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn&rsquo;t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn&rsquo;t age.</p><p>You can use an action to remove the flask&rsquo;s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.</p><p>An <em>identify</em> spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.</p><p><strong>Table- Iron Flask</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1‒50</td><td>Empty</td></tr><tr><td>51‒54</td><td>Demon (type 1)</td></tr><tr><td>55‒58</td><td>Demon (type 2)</td></tr><tr><td>59‒62</td><td>Demon (type 3)</td></tr><tr><td>63‒64</td><td>Demon (type 4)</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>Demon (type 5)</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>Demon (type 6)</td></tr><tr><td>67</td><td>Deva</td></tr><tr><td>68‒69</td><td>Devil (greater)</td></tr><tr><td>70‒73</td><td>Devil (lesser)</td></tr><tr><td>74‒75</td><td>Djinni</td></tr><tr><td>76‒77</td><td>Efreeti</td></tr><tr><td>78‒83</td><td>Elemental (any)</td></tr><tr><td>84‒86</td><td>Invisible stalker</td></tr><tr><td>87‒90</td><td>Night hag</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>Planetar</td></tr><tr><td>92‒95</td><td>Salamander</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td>Solar</td></tr><tr><td>97‒99</td><td>Succubus/incubus</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>Xorn</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#immovable-rod>Immovable Rod</a></li><li><a href=#instant-fortress>Instant Fortress</a></li><li><a href=#ioun-stone>Ioun Stone</a></li><li><a href=#iron-bands-of-binding>Iron Bands of Binding</a></li><li><a href=#iron-flask>Iron Flask</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
