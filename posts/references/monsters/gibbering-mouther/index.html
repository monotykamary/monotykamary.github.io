The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is dough-like difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Gibbering</strong></em>. The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn&rsquo;t incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can&rsquo;t take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can&rsquo;t make such an attack.</p><h6 id=actions>Actions</h6><p><em><strong>Multiattack</strong></em>. The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.</p><p><em><strong>Bites</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the mouther.</p><p><em><strong>Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5-6)</strong></em>. The mouther spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mouther&rsquo;s next turn.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
