The chuul can breathe air and water.</p><p><em><strong>Sense Magic</strong></em>. The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the <em>detect magic</em> spell but isn&rsquo;t itself magical.</p><h6 id=actions-2>Actions</h6><p><em><strong>Multiattack</strong></em>. The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.</p><p><em><strong>Pincer</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn&rsquo;t have two other creatures grappled.</p><p><em><strong>Tentacles</strong></em>. One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed.

While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.</p><p><em><strong>False Appearance</strong></em>. While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.</p><p><em><strong>Light Sensitivity</strong></em>. While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p><h6 id=actions-3>Actions</h6><p><em><strong>Multiattack</strong></em>. The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.</p><p><em><strong>Bite</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target&rsquo;s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.</p><p><em><strong>Tail</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage.</p><p><em><strong>Moan</strong></em>. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn&rsquo;t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker&rsquo;s next turn. If a creature&rsquo;s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker&rsquo;s moan for the next 24 hours</p><p><em><strong>Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</strong></em>. The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn&rsquo;t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.</p><p>Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can&rsquo;t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.</p><p>A duplicate has the cloaker&rsquo;s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.</p><h2 id=cockatrice>Cockatrice</h2><p><em>Small monstrosity, unaligned</em></p><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 11</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 27 (6d6+6)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft., fly 40 ft.</p><table><thead><tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6 (-2)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>2 (-4)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>5 (-3)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> -</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong> 1/2 (100 XP)</p><h6 id=actions-4>Actions</h6><p><em><strong>Bite</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 3 (1d4+1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw against being magically petrified. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends.

Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an action to shake the target awake.</p><p><em><strong>Constrict</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the couatl can&rsquo;t constrict another target.</p><p><em><strong>Change Shape</strong></em>. The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl&rsquo;s choice).</p><p>In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
