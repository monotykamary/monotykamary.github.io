The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p><p><em>Guards and wards</em> creates the following effects within the warded area.</p><p><em><strong>Corridors</strong></em>. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p><p><em><strong>Doors</strong></em>. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <em>arcane lock</em> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <em>minor illusion</em> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p><p><em><strong>Stairs</strong></em>. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <em>web</em> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while <em>guards and wards</em> lasts.</p><p><em><strong>Other Spell Effect</strong></em>. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p><ul><li>Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.</li><li>Place magic mouth in two locations.</li><li>Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.</li><li>Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.</li><li>Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.</li></ul><p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A <em>dispel magic</em> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.</p><p>You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
