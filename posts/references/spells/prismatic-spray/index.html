It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</li><li><em><strong>Violet</strong></em>. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM&rsquo;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn&rsquo;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)</li><li><em><strong>Special</strong></em>. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.</li></ul><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
