If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.</p><p>This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn&rsquo;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren&rsquo;t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.</p><p>This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.</p><p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p><p>Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can&rsquo;t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
