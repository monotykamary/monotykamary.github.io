This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.</p><p>At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return.</p><p>The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original&rsquo;s equipment. The original creature&rsquo;s physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can&rsquo;t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature&rsquo;s soul is elsewhere.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://monotykamary.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
